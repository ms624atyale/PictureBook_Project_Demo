"alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the bank and of having nothing to do  once or twice she had peeped into the book her sister was reading but it had no pictures or conversations in it and what is the use of a book thought alice without pictures or conversations  so she was considering in her own mind as well as she could for the hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid whether the pleasure of making a daisy chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and picking the daisies when suddenly a white rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her  there was nothing so very remarkable in that nor did alice think it so very much out of the way to hear the rabbit say to itself oh dear oh dear i shall be late when she thought it over afterwards it occurred to her that she ought to have wondered at this but at the time it all seemed quite natural but when the rabbit actually took a watch out of its waistcoat pocket and looked at it and then hurried on alice started to her feet for it flashed across her mind that she had never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat pocket or a watch to take out of it and burning with curiosity she ran across the field after it and fortunately was just in time to see it pop down a large rabbit hole under the hedge  in another moment down went alice after it never once considering how in the world she was to get out again  the rabbit hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way and then dipped suddenly down so suddenly that alice had not a moment to think about stopping herself before she found herself falling down a very deep well  either the well was very deep or she fell very slowly for she had plenty of time as she went down to look about her and to wonder what was going to happen next first she tried to look down and make out what she was coming to but it was too dark to see anything then she looked at the sides of the well and noticed that they were filled with cupboards and book shelves here and there she saw maps and pictures hung upon pegs she took down a jar from one of the shelves as she passed it was labelled orange marmalade but to her great disappointment it was empty  she did not like to drop the jar for fear of killing somebody underneath so managed to put it into one of the cupboards as she fell past it  well thought alice to herself after such a fall as this i shall think nothing of tumbling down stairs how brave theyll all think me at home why i wouldnt say anything about it even if i fell off the top of the house which was very likely true  down down down would the fall never come to an end i wonder how many miles ive fallen by this time she said aloud i must be getting somewhere near the centre of the earth let me see  that would be four thousand miles down i think  for you see alice had learnt several things of this sort in her lessons in the schoolroom and though this was not a very good opportunity for showing off her knowledge as there was no one to listen to her still it was good practice to say it over  yes thats about the right distance but then i wonder what latitude or longitude ive got to alice had no idea what latitude was or longitude either but thought they were nice grand words to say  presently she began again i wonder if i shall fall right through the earth how funny itll seem to come out among the people that walk with their heads downward the antipathies i think  she was rather glad there was no one listening this time as it didnt sound at all the right word  but i shall have to ask them what the name of the country is you know please maam is this new zealand or australia and she tried to curtsey as she spoke fancy curtseying as youre falling through the air do you think you could manage it and what an ignorant little girl shell think me for asking no itll never do to ask  perhaps i shall see it written up somewhere  down down down there was nothing else to do so alice soon began talking again dinahll miss me very much to night i should think dinah was the cat i hope theyll remember her saucer of milk at tea time dinah my dear i wish you were down here with me there are no mice in the air im afraid but you might catch a bat and thats very like a mouse you know but do cats eat bats i wonder and here alice began to get rather sleepy and went on saying to herself in a dreamy sort of way do cats eat bats do cats eat bats and sometimes do bats eat cats for you see as she couldnt answer either question it didnt much matter which way she put it she felt that she was dozing off and had just begun to dream that she was walking hand in hand with dinah and saying to her very earnestly now dinah tell me the truth  did you ever eat a bat when suddenly thump thump down she came upon a heap of sticks and dry leaves and the fall was over  alice was not a bit hurt and she jumped up on to her feet in a moment  she looked up but it was all dark overhead before her was another long passage and the white rabbit was still in sight hurrying down it there was not a moment to be lost  away went alice like the wind and was just in time to hear it say as it turned a corner oh my ears and whiskers how late its getting she was close behind it when she turned the corner but the rabbit was no longer to be seen  she found herself in a long low hall which was lit up by a row of lamps hanging from the roof  there were doors all round the hall but they were all locked and when alice had been all the way down one side and up the other trying every door she walked sadly down the middle wondering how she was ever to get out again  suddenly she came upon a little three legged table all made of solid glass there was nothing on it except a tiny golden key and alices first thought was that it might belong to one of the doors of the hall but alas either the locks were too large or the key was too small but at any rate it would not open any of them however on the second time round she came upon a low curtain she had not noticed before and behind it was a little door about fifteen inches high  she tried the little golden key in the lock and to her great delight it fitted  alice opened the door and found that it led into a small passage not much larger than a rat hole  she knelt down and looked along the passage into the loveliest garden you ever saw how she longed to get out of that dark hall and wander about among those beds of bright flowers and those cool fountains but she could not even get her head through the doorway and even if my head would go through thought poor alice it would be of very little use without my shoulders oh how i wish i could shut up like a telescope i think i could if i only knew how to begin for you see so many out of the way things had happened lately that alice had begun to think that very few things indeed were really impossible  there seemed to be no use in waiting by the little door so she went back to the table half hoping she might find another key on it or at any rate a book of rules for shutting people up like telescopes  this time she found a little bottle on it which certainly was not here before said alice and round the neck of the bottle was a paper label with the words drink me beautifully printed on it in large letters  it was all very well to say drink me but the wise little alice was not going to do that in a hurry no ill look first she said and see whether its marked â€˜poison or not for she had read several nice little histories about children who had got burnt and eaten up by wild beasts and other unpleasant things all because they would not remember the simple rules their friends had taught them  such as that a red hot poker will burn you if you hold it too long and that if you cut your finger very deeply with a knife it usually bleeds and she had never forgotten that if you drink much from a bottle marked poison it is almost certain to disagree with you sooner or later  however this bottle was not marked poison so alice ventured to taste it and finding it very nice it had in fact a sort of mixed flavour of cherry tart custard pine apple roast turkey toffee and hot buttered toast she very soon finished it off                                                                                                                   what a curious feeling said alice i must be shutting up like a telescope  and so it was indeed  she was now only ten inches high and her face brightened up at the thought that she was now the right size for going through the little door into that lovely garden first however she waited for a few minutes to see if she was going to shrink any further  she felt a little nervous about this for it might end you know said alice to herself in my going out altogether like a candle i wonder what i should be like then and she tried to fancy what the flame of a candle is like after the candle is blown out for she could not remember ever having seen such a thing  after a while finding that nothing more happened she decided on going into the garden at once but alas for poor alice when she got to the door she found she had forgotten the little golden key and when she went back to the table for it she found she could not possibly reach it  she could see it quite plainly through the glass and she tried her best to climb up one of the legs of the table but it was too slippery and when she had tired herself out with trying the poor little thing sat down and cried  come theres no use in crying like that said alice to herself rather sharply i advise you to leave off this minute she generally gave herself very good advice though she very seldom followed it and sometimes she scolded herself so severely as to bring tears into her eyes and once she remembered trying to box her own ears for having cheated herself in a game of croquet she was playing against herself for this curious child was very fond of pretending to be two people but its no use now thought poor alice to pretend to be two people why theres hardly enough of me left to make one respectable person  soon her eye fell on a little glass box that was lying under the table  she opened it and found in it a very small cake on which the words eat me were beautifully marked in currants well ill eat it said alice and if it makes me grow larger i can reach the key and if it makes me grow smaller i can creep under the door so either way ill get into the garden and i dont care which happens  she ate a little bit and said anxiously to herself which way which way holding her hand on the top of her head to feel which way it was growing and she was quite surprised to find that she remained the same size  to be sure this generally happens when one eats cake but alice had got so much into the way of expecting nothing but out of the way things to happen that it seemed quite dull and stupid for life to go on in the common way  so she set to work and very soon finished off the cake                                                                                                                     chapter ii the pool of tears   curiouser and curiouser cried alice she was so much surprised that for the moment she quite forgot how to speak good english now im opening out like the largest telescope that ever was good bye feet for when she looked down at her feet they seemed to be almost out of sight they were getting so far off oh my poor little feet i wonder who will put on your shoes and stockings for you now dears im sure i shant be able i shall be a great deal too far off to trouble myself about you  you must manage the best way you can but i must be kind to them thought alice or perhaps they wont walk the way i want to go let me see  ill give them a new pair of boots every christmas  and she went on planning to herself how she would manage it they must go by the carrier she thought and how funny itll seem sending presents to ones own feet and how odd the directions will look       alices right foot esq hearthrug near the fender with      alices love  oh dear what nonsense im talking  just then her head struck against the roof of the hall  in fact she was now more than nine feet high and she at once took up the little golden key and hurried off to the garden door  poor alice it was as much as she could do lying down on one side to look through into the garden with one eye but to get through was more hopeless than ever  she sat down and began to cry again  you ought to be ashamed of yourself said alice a great girl like you she might well say this to go on crying in this way stop this moment i tell you but she went on all the same shedding gallons of tears until there was a large pool all round her about four inches deep and reaching half down the hall  after a time she heard a little pattering of feet in the distance and she hastily dried her eyes to see what was coming it was the white rabbit returning splendidly dressed with a pair of white kid gloves in one hand and a large fan in the other  he came trotting along in a great hurry muttering to himself as he came oh the duchess the duchess oh wont she be savage if ive kept her waiting alice felt so desperate that she was ready to ask help of any one so when the rabbit came near her she began in a low timid voice if you please sir  the rabbit started violently dropped the white kid gloves and the fan and skurried away into the darkness as hard as he could go  alice took up the fan and gloves and as the hall was very hot she kept fanning herself all the time she went on talking  dear dear how queer everything is to day and yesterday things went on just as usual i wonder if ive been changed in the night let me think  was i the same when i got up this morning i almost think i can remember feeling a little different but if im not the same the next question is who in the world am i ah thats the great puzzle and she began thinking over all the children she knew that were of the same age as herself to see if she could have been changed for any of them  im sure im not ada she said for her hair goes in such long ringlets and mine doesnt go in ringlets at all and im sure i cant be mabel for i know all sorts of things and she oh she knows such a very little besides shes she and im i and oh dear how puzzling it all is ill try if i know all the things i used to know let me see  four times five is twelve and four times six is thirteen and four times seven is oh dear i shall never get to twenty at that rate however the multiplication table doesnt signify  lets try geography london is the capital of paris and paris is the capital of rome and rome no thats all wrong im certain i must have been changed for mabel ill try and say â€˜how doth the little  and she crossed her hands on her lap as if she were saying lessons and began to repeat it but her voice sounded hoarse and strange and the words did not come the same as they used to do    how doth the little crocodile     improve his shining tail and pour the waters of the nile     on every golden scale  how cheerfully he seems to grin     how neatly spread his claws and welcome little fishes in     with gently smiling jaws   im sure those are not the right words said poor alice and her eyes filled with tears again as she went on i must be mabel after all and i shall have to go and live in that poky little house and have next to no toys to play with and oh ever so many lessons to learn no ive made up my mind about it if im mabel ill stay down here itll be no use their putting their heads down and saying â€˜come up again dear i shall only look up and say â€˜who am i then tell me that first and then if i like being that person ill come up  if not ill stay down here till im somebody else but oh dear cried alice with a sudden burst of tears i do wish they would put their heads down i am so very tired of being all alone here  as she said this she looked down at her hands and was surprised to see that she had put on one of the rabbits little white kid gloves while she was talking how can i have done that she thought i must be growing small again she got up and went to the table to measure herself by it and found that as nearly as she could guess she was now about two feet high and was going on shrinking rapidly  she soon found out that the cause of this was the fan she was holding and she dropped it hastily just in time to avoid shrinking away altogether  that was a narrow escape said alice a good deal frightened at the sudden change but very glad to find herself still in existence and now for the garden and she ran with all speed back to the little door  but alas the little door was shut again and the little golden key was lying on the glass table as before and things are worse than ever thought the poor child for i never was so small as this before never and i declare its too bad that it is  as she said these words her foot slipped and in another moment splash she was up to her chin in salt water her first idea was that she had somehow fallen into the sea and in that case i can go back by railway she said to herself alice had been to the seaside once in her life and had come to the general conclusion that wherever you go to on the english coast you find a number of bathing machines in the sea some children digging in the sand with wooden spades then a row of lodging houses and behind them a railway station however she soon made out that she was in the pool of tears which she had wept when she was nine feet high  i wish i hadnt cried so much said alice as she swam about trying to find her way out i shall be punished for it now i suppose by being drowned in my own tears that will be a queer thing to be sure however everything is queer to day  just then she heard something splashing about in the pool a little way off and she swam nearer to make out what it was  at first she thought it must be a walrus or hippopotamus but then she remembered how small she was now and she soon made out that it was only a mouse that had slipped in like herself  would it be of any use now thought alice to speak to this mouse everything is so out of the way down here that i should think very likely it can talk  at any rate theres no harm in trying so she began  o mouse do you know the way out of this pool i am very tired of swimming about here o mouse alice thought this must be the right way of speaking to a mouse  she had never done such a thing before but she remembered having seen in her brothers latin grammar a mouse of a mouse to a mouse a mouse o mouse the mouse looked at her rather inquisitively and seemed to her to wink with one of its little eyes but it said nothing  perhaps it doesnt understand english thought alice i daresay its a french mouse come over with william the conqueror for with all her knowledge of history alice had no very clear notion how long ago anything had happened so she began again  oÃ¹ est ma chatte which was the first sentence in her french lesson book the mouse gave a sudden leap out of the water and seemed to quiver all over with fright oh i beg your pardon cried alice hastily afraid that she had hurt the poor animals feelings i quite forgot you didnt like cats  not like cats cried the mouse in a shrill passionate voice would you like cats if you were me  well perhaps not said alice in a soothing tone  dont be angry about it and yet i wish i could show you our cat dinah  i think youd take a fancy to cats if you could only see her she is such a dear quiet thing alice went on half to herself as she swam lazily about in the pool and she sits purring so nicely by the fire licking her paws and washing her face and she is such a nice soft thing to nurse and shes such a capital one for catching mice oh i beg your pardon cried alice again for this time the mouse was bristling all over and she felt certain it must be really offended we wont talk about her any more if youd rather not  we indeed cried the mouse who was trembling down to the end of his tail as if i would talk on such a subject our family always hated cats  nasty low vulgar things dont let me hear the name again  i wont indeed said alice in a great hurry to change the subject of conversation are you are you fond of of dogs the mouse did not answer so alice went on eagerly  there is such a nice little dog near our house i should like to show you a little bright eyed terrier you know with oh such long curly brown hair and itll fetch things when you throw them and itll sit up and beg for its dinner and all sorts of things i cant remember half of them and it belongs to a farmer you know and he says its so useful its worth a hundred pounds he says it kills all the rats and oh dear cried alice in a sorrowful tone im afraid ive offended it again for the mouse was swimming away from her as hard as it could go and making quite a commotion in the pool as it went  so she called softly after it mouse dear do come back again and we wont talk about cats or dogs either if you dont like them when the mouse heard this it turned round and swam slowly back to her  its face was quite pale with passion alice thought and it said in a low trembling voice let us get to the shore and then ill tell you my history and youll understand why it is i hate cats and dogs  it was high time to go for the pool was getting quite crowded with the birds and animals that had fallen into it  there were a duck and a dodo a lory and an eaglet and several other curious creatures alice led the way and the whole party swam to the shore     chapter iii a caucus race and a long tale   they were indeed a queer looking party that assembled on the bank the birds with draggled feathers the animals with their fur clinging close to them and all dripping wet cross and uncomfortable  the first question of course was how to get dry again  they had a consultation about this and after a few minutes it seemed quite natural to alice to find herself talking familiarly with them as if she had known them all her life indeed she had quite a long argument with the lory who at last turned sulky and would only say i am older than you and must know better and this alice would not allow without knowing how old it was and as the lory positively refused to tell its age there was no more to be said  at last the mouse who seemed to be a person of authority among them called out sit down all of you and listen to me ill soon make you dry enough they all sat down at once in a large ring with the mouse in the middle alice kept her eyes anxiously fixed on it for she felt sure she would catch a bad cold if she did not get dry very soon  ahem said the mouse with an important air are you all ready this is the driest thing i know silence all round if you please â€˜william the conqueror whose cause was favoured by the pope was soon submitted to by the english who wanted leaders and had been of late much accustomed to usurpation and conquest edwin and morcar the earls of mercia and northumbria   ugh said the lory with a shiver  i beg your pardon said the mouse frowning but very politely  did you speak  not i said the lory hastily  i thought you did said the mouse  i proceed â€˜edwin and morcar the earls of mercia and northumbria declared for him  and even stigand the patriotic archbishop of canterbury found it advisable   found what said the duck  found it the mouse replied rather crossly  of course you know what â€˜it means  i know what â€˜it means well enough when i find a thing said the duck  its generally a frog or a worm the question is what did the archbishop find  the mouse did not notice this question but hurriedly went on â€˜ found it advisable to go with edgar atheling to meet william and offer him the crown williams conduct at first was moderate but the insolence of his normans  how are you getting on now my dear it continued turning to alice as it spoke  as wet as ever said alice in a melancholy tone  it doesnt seem to dry me at all  in that case said the dodo solemnly rising to its feet i move that the meeting adjourn for the immediate adoption of more energetic remedies   speak english said the eaglet i dont know the meaning of half those long words and whats more i dont believe you do either and the eaglet bent down its head to hide a smile  some of the other birds tittered audibly  what i was going to say said the dodo in an offended tone was that the best thing to get us dry would be a caucus race  what is a caucus race said alice not that she wanted much to know but the dodo had paused as if it thought that somebody ought to speak and no one else seemed inclined to say anything  why said the dodo the best way to explain it is to do it and as you might like to try the thing yourself some winter day i will tell you how the dodo managed it  first it marked out a race course in a sort of circle the exact shape doesnt matter it said and then all the party were placed along the course here and there there was no one two three and away but they began running when they liked and left off when they liked so that it was not easy to know when the race was over however when they had been running half an hour or so and were quite dry again the dodo suddenly called out the race is over and they all crowded round it panting and asking but who has won  this question the dodo could not answer without a great deal of thought and it sat for a long time with one finger pressed upon its forehead the position in which you usually see shakespeare in the pictures of him while the rest waited in silence at last the dodo said everybody has won and all must have prizes  but who is to give the prizes quite a chorus of voices asked  why she of course said the dodo pointing to alice with one finger and the whole party at once crowded round her calling out in a confused way prizes prizes  alice had no idea what to do and in despair she put her hand in her pocket and pulled out a box of comfits luckily the salt water had not got into it and handed them round as prizes there was exactly one a piece all round  but she must have a prize herself you know said the mouse  of course the dodo replied very gravely what else have you got in your pocket he went on turning to alice  only a thimble said alice sadly  hand it over here said the dodo  then they all crowded round her once more while the dodo solemnly presented the thimble saying we beg your acceptance of this elegant thimble and when it had finished this short speech they all cheered  alice thought the whole thing very absurd but they all looked so grave that she did not dare to laugh and as she could not think of anything to say she simply bowed and took the thimble looking as solemn as she could  the next thing was to eat the comfits  this caused some noise and confusion as the large birds complained that they could not taste theirs and the small ones choked and had to be patted on the back however it was over at last and they sat down again in a ring and begged the mouse to tell them something more  you promised to tell me your history you know said alice and why it is you hate c and d she added in a whisper half afraid that it would be offended again  mine is a long and a sad tale said the mouse turning to alice and sighing  it is a long tail certainly said alice looking down with wonder at the mouses tail but why do you call it sad and she kept on puzzling about it while the mouse was speaking so that her idea of the tale was something like this             fury said to a mouse that he met in the house â€˜let us both          go to law  i will prosecute you come ill take no          denial we must have a trial  for really this morning ive          nothing to do said the mouse to the cur â€˜such a trial dear          sir with no jury or judge would be wasting our breath          â€˜ill be judge ill be jury said cunning old fury  â€˜ill          try the whole cause and condemn you to death  you are not attending said the mouse to alice severely what are you thinking of  i beg your pardon said alice very humbly  you had got to the fifth bend i think  i had not cried the mouse sharply and very angrily  a knot said alice always ready to make herself useful and looking anxiously about her oh do let me help to undo it  i shall do nothing of the sort said the mouse getting up and walking away you insult me by talking such nonsense  i didnt mean it pleaded poor alice but youre so easily offended you know  the mouse only growled in reply  please come back and finish your story alice called after it and the others all joined in chorus yes please do but the mouse only shook its head impatiently and walked a little quicker  what a pity it wouldnt stay sighed the lory as soon as it was quite out of sight and an old crab took the opportunity of saying to her daughter ah my dear let this be a lesson to you never to lose your temper hold your tongue ma said the young crab a little snappishly youre enough to try the patience of an oyster  i wish i had our dinah here i know i do said alice aloud addressing nobody in particular shed soon fetch it back  and who is dinah if i might venture to ask the question said the lory  alice replied eagerly for she was always ready to talk about her pet  dinahs our cat and shes such a capital one for catching mice you cant think and oh i wish you could see her after the birds why shell eat a little bird as soon as look at it  this speech caused a remarkable sensation among the party some of the birds hurried off at once  one old magpie began wrapping itself up very carefully remarking i really must be getting home the night air doesnt suit my throat and a canary called out in a trembling voice to its children come away my dears its high time you were all in bed on various pretexts they all moved off and alice was soon left alone  i wish i hadnt mentioned dinah she said to herself in a melancholy tone nobody seems to like her down here and im sure shes the best cat in the world oh my dear dinah i wonder if i shall ever see you any more and here poor alice began to cry again for she felt very lonely and low spirited in a little while however she again heard a little pattering of footsteps in the distance and she looked up eagerly half hoping that the mouse had changed his mind and was coming back to finish his story     chapter iv the rabbit sends in a little bill   it was the white rabbit trotting slowly back again and looking anxiously about as it went as if it had lost something and she heard it muttering to itself the duchess the duchess oh my dear paws oh my fur and whiskers shell get me executed as sure as ferrets are ferrets where can i have dropped them i wonder alice guessed in a moment that it was looking for the fan and the pair of white kid gloves and she very good naturedly began hunting about for them but they were nowhere to be seen everything seemed to have changed since her swim in the pool and the great hall with the glass table and the little door had vanished completely  very soon the rabbit noticed alice as she went hunting about and called out to her in an angry tone why mary ann what are you doing out here run home this moment and fetch me a pair of gloves and a fan quick now and alice was so much frightened that she ran off at once in the direction it pointed to without trying to explain the mistake it had made  he took me for his housemaid she said to herself as she ran how surprised hell be when he finds out who i am but id better take him his fan and gloves that is if i can find them as she said this she came upon a neat little house on the door of which was a bright brass plate with the name w rabbit engraved upon it she went in without knocking and hurried upstairs in great fear lest she should meet the real mary ann and be turned out of the house before she had found the fan and gloves  how queer it seems alice said to herself to be going messages for a rabbit i suppose dinahll be sending me on messages next and she began fancying the sort of thing that would happen  â€˜miss alice come here directly and get ready for your walk â€˜coming in a minute nurse but ive got to see that the mouse doesnt get out only i dont think alice went on that theyd let dinah stop in the house if it began ordering people about like that  by this time she had found her way into a tidy little room with a table in the window and on it as she had hoped a fan and two or three pairs of tiny white kid gloves  she took up the fan and a pair of the gloves and was just going to leave the room when her eye fell upon a little bottle that stood near the looking glass there was no label this time with the words drink me but nevertheless she uncorked it and put it to her lips i know something interesting is sure to happen she said to herself whenever i eat or drink anything so ill just see what this bottle does i do hope itll make me grow large again for really im quite tired of being such a tiny little thing  it did so indeed and much sooner than she had expected  before she had drunk half the bottle she found her head pressing against the ceiling and had to stoop to save her neck from being broken she hastily put down the bottle saying to herself thats quite enough i hope i shant grow any more as it is i cant get out at the door i do wish i hadnt drunk quite so much  alas it was too late to wish that she went on growing and growing and very soon had to kneel down on the floor  in another minute there was not even room for this and she tried the effect of lying down with one elbow against the door and the other arm curled round her head still she went on growing and as a last resource she put one arm out of the window and one foot up the chimney and said to herself now i can do no more whatever happens what will become of me  luckily for alice the little magic bottle had now had its full effect and she grew no larger  still it was very uncomfortable and as there seemed to be no sort of chance of her ever getting out of the room again no wonder she felt unhappy  it was much pleasanter at home thought poor alice when one wasnt always growing larger and smaller and being ordered about by mice and rabbits i almost wish i hadnt gone down that rabbit hole and yet and yet its rather curious you know this sort of life i do wonder what can have happened to me when i used to read fairy tales i fancied that kind of thing never happened and now here i am in the middle of one there ought to be a book written about me that there ought and when i grow up ill write one but im grown up now she added in a sorrowful tone at least theres no room to grow up any more here  but then thought alice shall i never get any older than i am now thatll be a comfort one way never to be an old woman but then always to have lessons to learn oh i shouldnt like that  oh you foolish alice she answered herself how can you learn lessons in here why theres hardly room for you and no room at all for any lesson books  and so she went on taking first one side and then the other and making quite a conversation of it altogether but after a few minutes she heard a voice outside and stopped to listen  mary ann mary ann said the voice fetch me my gloves this moment then came a little pattering of feet on the stairs alice knew it was the rabbit coming to look for her and she trembled till she shook the house quite forgetting that she was now about a thousand times as large as the rabbit and had no reason to be afraid of it  presently the rabbit came up to the door and tried to open it but as the door opened inwards and alices elbow was pressed hard against it that attempt proved a failure alice heard it say to itself then ill go round and get in at the window  that you wont thought alice and after waiting till she fancied she heard the rabbit just under the window she suddenly spread out her hand and made a snatch in the air she did not get hold of anything but she heard a little shriek and a fall and a crash of broken glass from which she concluded that it was just possible it had fallen into a cucumber frame or something of the sort  next came an angry voice the rabbits pat pat where are you and then a voice she had never heard before sure then im here digging for apples yer honour  digging for apples indeed said the rabbit angrily here come and help me out of this sounds of more broken glass  now tell me pat whats that in the window  sure its an arm yer honour he pronounced it arrum  an arm you goose who ever saw one that size why it fills the whole window  sure it does yer honour  but its an arm for all that  well its got no business there at any rate  go and take it away  there was a long silence after this and alice could only hear whispers now and then such as sure i dont like it yer honour at all at all do as i tell you you coward and at last she spread out her hand again and made another snatch in the air this time there were two little shrieks and more sounds of broken glass what a number of cucumber frames there must be thought alice i wonder what theyll do next as for pulling me out of the window i only wish they could im sure i dont want to stay in here any longer  she waited for some time without hearing anything more  at last came a rumbling of little cartwheels and the sound of a good many voices all talking together  she made out the words  wheres the other ladder why i hadnt to bring but one bills got the other bill fetch it here lad here put em up at this corner no tie em together first they dont reach half high enough yet oh theyll do well enough dont be particular here bill catch hold of this rope will the roof bear mind that loose slate oh its coming down heads below a loud crash now who did that it was bill i fancy whos to go down the chimney nay i shant you do it that i wont then bills to go down here bill the master says youre to go down the chimney  oh so bills got to come down the chimney has he said alice to herself shy they seem to put everything upon bill i wouldnt be in bills place for a good deal  this fireplace is narrow to be sure but i think i can kick a little  she drew her foot as far down the chimney as she could and waited till she heard a little animal she couldnt guess of what sort it was scratching and scrambling about in the chimney close above her  then saying to herself this is bill she gave one sharp kick and waited to see what would happen next  the first thing she heard was a general chorus of there goes bill then the rabbits voice along catch him you by the hedge then silence and then another confusion of voices hold up his head brandy now dont choke him how was it old fellow what happened to you tell us all about it  last came a little feeble squeaking voice thats bill thought alice well i hardly know no more thank ye im better now but im a deal too flustered to tell you all i know is something comes at me like a jack in the box and up i goes like a sky rocket  so you did old fellow said the others  we must burn the house down said the rabbits voice and alice called out as loud as she could if you do ill set dinah at you  there was a dead silence instantly and alice thought to herself i wonder what they will do next if they had any sense theyd take the roof off after a minute or two they began moving about again and alice heard the rabbit say a barrowful will do to begin with  a barrowful of what thought alice but she had not long to doubt for the next moment a shower of little pebbles came rattling in at the window and some of them hit her in the face ill put a stop to this she said to herself and shouted out youd better not do that again which produced another dead silence  alice noticed with some surprise that the pebbles were all turning into little cakes as they lay on the floor and a bright idea came into her head if i eat one of these cakes she thought its sure to make some change in my size and as it cant possibly make me larger it must make me smaller i suppose  so she swallowed one of the cakes and was delighted to find that she began shrinking directly as soon as she was small enough to get through the door she ran out of the house and found quite a crowd of little animals and birds waiting outside the poor little lizard bill was in the middle being held up by two guinea pigs who were giving it something out of a bottle they all made a rush at alice the moment she appeared but she ran off as hard as she could and soon found herself safe in a thick wood  the first thing ive got to do said alice to herself as she wandered about in the wood is to grow to my right size again and the second thing is to find my way into that lovely garden i think that will be the best plan  it sounded an excellent plan no doubt and very neatly and simply arranged the only difficulty was that she had not the smallest idea how to set about it and while she was peering about anxiously among the trees a little sharp bark just over her head made her look up in a great hurry  an enormous puppy was looking down at her with large round eyes and feebly stretching out one paw trying to touch her poor little thing said alice in a coaxing tone and she tried hard to whistle to it but she was terribly frightened all the time at the thought that it might be hungry in which case it would be very likely to eat her up in spite of all her coaxing  hardly knowing what she did she picked up a little bit of stick and held it out to the puppy whereupon the puppy jumped into the air off all its feet at once with a yelp of delight and rushed at the stick and made believe to worry it then alice dodged behind a great thistle to keep herself from being run over and the moment she appeared on the other side the puppy made another rush at the stick and tumbled head over heels in its hurry to get hold of it then alice thinking it was very like having a game of play with a cart horse and expecting every moment to be trampled under its feet ran round the thistle again then the puppy began a series of short charges at the stick running a very little way forwards each time and a long way back and barking hoarsely all the while till at last it sat down a good way off panting with its tongue hanging out of its mouth and its great eyes half shut  this seemed to alice a good opportunity for making her escape so she set off at once and ran till she was quite tired and out of breath and till the puppys bark sounded quite faint in the distance  and yet what a dear little puppy it was said alice as she leant against a buttercup to rest herself and fanned herself with one of the leaves  i should have liked teaching it tricks very much if if id only been the right size to do it oh dear id nearly forgotten that ive got to grow up again let me see how is it to be managed i suppose i ought to eat or drink something or other but the great question is what  the great question certainly was what alice looked all round her at the flowers and the blades of grass but she did not see anything that looked like the right thing to eat or drink under the circumstances there was a large mushroom growing near her about the same height as herself and when she had looked under it and on both sides of it and behind it it occurred to her that she might as well look and see what was on the top of it  she stretched herself up on tiptoe and peeped over the edge of the mushroom and her eyes immediately met those of a large blue caterpillar that was sitting on the top with its arms folded quietly smoking a long hookah and taking not the smallest notice of her or of anything else     chapter v advice from a caterpillar   the caterpillar and alice looked at each other for some time in silence  at last the caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth and addressed her in a languid sleepy voice  who are you said the caterpillar  this was not an encouraging opening for a conversation alice replied rather shyly i i hardly know sir just at present at least i know who i was when i got up this morning but i think i must have been changed several times since then  what do you mean by that said the caterpillar sternly explain yourself  i cant explain myself im afraid sir said alice because im not myself you see  i dont see said the caterpillar  im afraid i cant put it more clearly alice replied very politely for i cant understand it myself to begin with and being so many different sizes in a day is very confusing  it isnt said the caterpillar  well perhaps you havent found it so yet said alice but when you have to turn into a chrysalis you will some day you know and then after that into a butterfly i should think youll feel it a little queer wont you  not a bit said the caterpillar  well perhaps your feelings may be different said alice all i know is it would feel very queer to me  you said the caterpillar contemptuously who are you  which brought them back again to the beginning of the conversation alice felt a little irritated at the caterpillars making such very short remarks and she drew herself up and said very gravely i think you ought to tell me who you are first  why said the caterpillar  here was another puzzling question and as alice could not think of any good reason and as the caterpillar seemed to be in a very unpleasant state of mind she turned away  come back the caterpillar called after her ive something important to say  this sounded promising certainly  alice turned and came back again  keep your temper said the caterpillar  is that all said alice swallowing down her anger as well as she could  no said the caterpillar  alice thought she might as well wait as she had nothing else to do and perhaps after all it might tell her something worth hearing for some minutes it puffed away without speaking but at last it unfolded its arms took the hookah out of its mouth again and said so you think youre changed do you  im afraid i am sir said alice i cant remember things as i used and i dont keep the same size for ten minutes together  cant remember what things said the caterpillar  well ive tried to say how doth the little busy bee but it all came different alice replied in a very melancholy voice  repeat â€˜you are old father william said the caterpillar  alice folded her hands and began    you are old father william the young man said     and your hair has become very white and yet you incessantly stand on your head      do you think at your age it is right  in my youth father william replied to his son     i feared it might injure the brain but now that im perfectly sure i have none     why i do it again and again  you are old said the youth as i mentioned before     and have grown most uncommonly fat yet you turned a back somersault in at the door      pray what is the reason of that  in my youth said the sage as he shook his grey locks     i kept all my limbs very supple by the use of this ointment one shilling the box      allow me to sell you a couple  you are old said the youth and your jaws are too weak     for anything tougher than suet yet you finished the goose with the bones and the beak      pray how did you manage to do it  in my youth said his father i took to the law     and argued each case with my wife and the muscular strength which it gave to my jaw     has lasted the rest of my life  you are old said the youth one would hardly suppose     that your eye was as steady as ever yet you balanced an eel on the end of your nose      what made you so awfully clever  i have answered three questions and that is enough     said his father dont give yourself airs do you think i can listen all day to such stuff     be off or ill kick you down stairs   that is not said right said the caterpillar  not quite right im afraid said alice timidly some of the words have got altered  it is wrong from beginning to end said the caterpillar decidedly and there was silence for some minutes  the caterpillar was the first to speak  what size do you want to be it asked  oh im not particular as to size alice hastily replied only one doesnt like changing so often you know  i dont know said the caterpillar  alice said nothing  she had never been so much contradicted in her life before and she felt that she was losing her temper  are you content now said the caterpillar  well i should like to be a little larger sir if you wouldnt mind said alice  three inches is such a wretched height to be  it is a very good height indeed said the caterpillar angrily rearing itself upright as it spoke it was exactly three inches high  but im not used to it pleaded poor alice in a piteous tone and she thought of herself i wish the creatures wouldnt be so easily offended  youll get used to it in time said the caterpillar and it put the hookah into its mouth and began smoking again  this time alice waited patiently until it chose to speak again in a minute or two the caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth and yawned once or twice and shook itself then it got down off the mushroom and crawled away in the grass merely remarking as it went one side will make you grow taller and the other side will make you grow shorter  one side of what the other side of what thought alice to herself  of the mushroom said the caterpillar just as if she had asked it aloud and in another moment it was out of sight  alice remained looking thoughtfully at the mushroom for a minute trying to make out which were the two sides of it and as it was perfectly round she found this a very difficult question however at last she stretched her arms round it as far as they would go and broke off a bit of the edge with each hand  and now which is which she said to herself and nibbled a little of the right hand bit to try the effect  the next moment she felt a violent blow underneath her chin  it had struck her foot  she was a good deal frightened by this very sudden change but she felt that there was no time to be lost as she was shrinking rapidly so she set to work at once to eat some of the other bit her chin was pressed so closely against her foot that there was hardly room to open her mouth but she did it at last and managed to swallow a morsel of the lefthand bit                                                                                                                   come my heads free at last said alice in a tone of delight which changed into alarm in another moment when she found that her shoulders were nowhere to be found  all she could see when she looked down was an immense length of neck which seemed to rise like a stalk out of a sea of green leaves that lay far below her  what can all that green stuff be said alice and where have my shoulders got to and oh my poor hands how is it i cant see you she was moving them about as she spoke but no result seemed to follow except a little shaking among the distant green leaves  as there seemed to be no chance of getting her hands up to her head she tried to get her head down to them and was delighted to find that her neck would bend about easily in any direction like a serpent she had just succeeded in curving it down into a graceful zigzag and was going to dive in among the leaves which she found to be nothing but the tops of the trees under which she had been wandering when a sharp hiss made her draw back in a hurry  a large pigeon had flown into her face and was beating her violently with its wings  serpent screamed the pigeon  im not a serpent said alice indignantly let me alone  serpent i say again repeated the pigeon but in a more subdued tone and added with a kind of sob ive tried every way and nothing seems to suit them  i havent the least idea what youre talking about said alice  ive tried the roots of trees and ive tried banks and ive tried hedges the pigeon went on without attending to her but those serpents theres no pleasing them  alice was more and more puzzled but she thought there was no use in saying anything more till the pigeon had finished  as if it wasnt trouble enough hatching the eggs said the pigeon but i must be on the look out for serpents night and day why i havent had a wink of sleep these three weeks  im very sorry youve been annoyed said alice who was beginning to see its meaning  and just as id taken the highest tree in the wood continued the pigeon raising its voice to a shriek and just as i was thinking i should be free of them at last they must needs come wriggling down from the sky ugh serpent  but im not a serpent i tell you said alice im a im a   well what are you said the pigeon i can see youre trying to invent something  i im a little girl said alice rather doubtfully as she remembered the number of changes she had gone through that day  a likely story indeed said the pigeon in a tone of the deepest contempt ive seen a good many little girls in my time but never one with such a neck as that no no youre a serpent and theres no use denying it i suppose youll be telling me next that you never tasted an egg  i have tasted eggs certainly said alice who was a very truthful child but little girls eat eggs quite as much as serpents do you know  i dont believe it said the pigeon but if they do why then theyre a kind of serpent thats all i can say  this was such a new idea to alice that she was quite silent for a minute or two which gave the pigeon the opportunity of adding youre looking for eggs i know that well enough and what does it matter to me whether youre a little girl or a serpent  it matters a good deal to me said alice hastily but im not looking for eggs as it happens and if i was i shouldnt want yours  i dont like them raw  well be off then said the pigeon in a sulky tone as it settled down again into its nest alice crouched down among the trees as well as she could for her neck kept getting entangled among the branches and every now and then she had to stop and untwist it after a while she remembered that she still held the pieces of mushroom in her hands and she set to work very carefully nibbling first at one and then at the other and growing sometimes taller and sometimes shorter until she had succeeded in bringing herself down to her usual height  it was so long since she had been anything near the right size that it felt quite strange at first but she got used to it in a few minutes and began talking to herself as usual come theres half my plan done now how puzzling all these changes are im never sure what im going to be from one minute to another however ive got back to my right size  the next thing is to get into that beautiful garden how is that to be done i wonder as she said this she came suddenly upon an open place with a little house in it about four feet high whoever lives there thought alice itll never do to come upon them this size  why i should frighten them out of their wits so she began nibbling at the righthand bit again and did not venture to go near the house till she had brought herself down to nine inches high     chapter vi pig and pepper   for a minute or two she stood looking at the house and wondering what to do next when suddenly a footman in livery came running out of the wood she considered him to be a footman because he was in livery  otherwise judging by his face only she would have called him a fish and rapped loudly at the door with his knuckles it was opened by another footman in livery with a round face and large eyes like a frog and both footmen alice noticed had powdered hair that curled all over their heads she felt very curious to know what it was all about and crept a little way out of the wood to listen  the fish footman began by producing from under his arm a great letter nearly as large as himself and this he handed over to the other saying in a solemn tone for the duchess an invitation from the queen to play croquet the frog footman repeated in the same solemn tone only changing the order of the words a little from the queen an invitation for the duchess to play croquet  then they both bowed low and their curls got entangled together  alice laughed so much at this that she had to run back into the wood for fear of their hearing her and when she next peeped out the fish footman was gone and the other was sitting on the ground near the door staring stupidly up into the sky  alice went timidly up to the door and knocked  theres no sort of use in knocking said the footman and that for two reasons first because im on the same side of the door as you are secondly because theyre making such a noise inside no one could possibly hear you and certainly there was a most extraordinary noise going on within a constant howling and sneezing and every now and then a great crash as if a dish or kettle had been broken to pieces  please then said alice how am i to get in  there might be some sense in your knocking the footman went on without attending to her if we had the door between us for instance if you were inside you might knock and i could let you out you know he was looking up into the sky all the time he was speaking and this alice thought decidedly uncivil but perhaps he cant help it she said to herself his eyes are so very nearly at the top of his head but at any rate he might answer questions how am i to get in she repeated aloud  i shall sit here the footman remarked till tomorrow   at this moment the door of the house opened and a large plate came skimming out straight at the footmans head  it just grazed his nose and broke to pieces against one of the trees behind him   or next day maybe the footman continued in the same tone exactly as if nothing had happened  how am i to get in asked alice again in a louder tone  are you to get in at all said the footman thats the first question you know  it was no doubt  only alice did not like to be told so its really dreadful she muttered to herself the way all the creatures argue its enough to drive one crazy  the footman seemed to think this a good opportunity for repeating his remark with variations i shall sit here he said on and off for days and days  but what am i to do said alice  anything you like said the footman and began whistling  oh theres no use in talking to him said alice desperately  hes perfectly idiotic and she opened the door and went in  the door led right into a large kitchen which was full of smoke from one end to the other  the duchess was sitting on a three legged stool in the middle nursing a baby the cook was leaning over the fire stirring a large cauldron which seemed to be full of soup  theres certainly too much pepper in that soup alice said to herself as well as she could for sneezing  there was certainly too much of it in the air even the duchess sneezed occasionally and as for the baby it was sneezing and howling alternately without a moments pause the only things in the kitchen that did not sneeze were the cook and a large cat which was sitting on the hearth and grinning from ear to ear  please would you tell me said alice a little timidly for she was not quite sure whether it was good manners for her to speak first why your cat grins like that  its a cheshire cat said the duchess and thats why pig  she said the last word with such sudden violence that alice quite jumped but she saw in another moment that it was addressed to the baby and not to her so she took courage and went on again    i didnt know that cheshire cats always grinned in fact i didnt know that cats could grin  they all can said the duchess and most of em do  i dont know of any that do alice said very politely feeling quite pleased to have got into a conversation  you dont know much said the duchess and thats a fact  alice did not at all like the tone of this remark and thought it would be as well to introduce some other subject of conversation while she was trying to fix on one the cook took the cauldron of soup off the fire and at once set to work throwing everything within her reach at the duchess and the baby the fire irons came first then followed a shower of saucepans plates and dishes the duchess took no notice of them even when they hit her and the baby was howling so much already that it was quite impossible to say whether the blows hurt it or not  oh please mind what youre doing cried alice jumping up and down in an agony of terror oh there goes his precious nose as an unusually large saucepan flew close by it and very nearly carried it off  if everybody minded their own business the duchess said in a hoarse growl the world would go round a deal faster than it does  which would not be an advantage said alice who felt very glad to get an opportunity of showing off a little of her knowledge just think of what work it would make with the day and night you see the earth takes twenty four hours to turn round on its axis   talking of axes said the duchess chop off her head  alice glanced rather anxiously at the cook to see if she meant to take the hint but the cook was busily stirring the soup and seemed not to be listening so she went on again  twenty four hours i think or is it twelve i   oh dont bother me said the duchess i never could abide figures and with that she began nursing her child again singing a sort of lullaby to it as she did so and giving it a violent shake at the end of every line   speak roughly to your little boy     and beat him when he sneezes  he only does it to annoy     because he knows it teases   chorus in which the cook and the baby joined    wow wow wow   while the duchess sang the second verse of the song she kept tossing the baby violently up and down and the poor little thing howled so that alice could hardly hear the words    i speak severely to my boy     i beat him when he sneezes for he can thoroughly enjoy     the pepper when he pleases   chorus   wow wow wow   here you may nurse it a bit if you like the duchess said to alice flinging the baby at her as she spoke i must go and get ready to play croquet with the queen and she hurried out of the room the cook threw a frying pan after her as she went out but it just missed her  alice caught the baby with some difficulty as it was a queer shaped little creature and held out its arms and legs in all directions just like a star fish thought alice the poor little thing was snorting like a steam engine when she caught it and kept doubling itself up and straightening itself out again so that altogether for the first minute or two it was as much as she could do to hold it  as soon as she had made out the proper way of nursing it which was to twist it up into a sort of knot and then keep tight hold of its right ear and left foot so as to prevent its undoing itself she carried it out into the open air if i dont take this child away with me thought alice theyre sure to kill it in a day or two  wouldnt it be murder to leave it behind she said the last words out loud and the little thing grunted in reply it had left off sneezing by this time dont grunt said alice thats not at all a proper way of expressing yourself  the baby grunted again and alice looked very anxiously into its face to see what was the matter with it there could be no doubt that it had a very turn up nose much more like a snout than a real nose also its eyes were getting extremely small for a baby  altogether alice did not like the look of the thing at all but perhaps it was only sobbing she thought and looked into its eyes again to see if there were any tears  no there were no tears if youre going to turn into a pig my dear said alice seriously ill have nothing more to do with you mind now the poor little thing sobbed again or grunted it was impossible to say which and they went on for some while in silence  alice was just beginning to think to herself now what am i to do with this creature when i get it home when it grunted again so violently that she looked down into its face in some alarm this time there could be no mistake about it  it was neither more nor less than a pig and she felt that it would be quite absurd for her to carry it further  so she set the little creature down and felt quite relieved to see it trot away quietly into the wood if it had grown up she said to herself it would have made a dreadfully ugly child  but it makes rather a handsome pig i think and she began thinking over other children she knew who might do very well as pigs and was just saying to herself if one only knew the right way to change them  when she was a little startled by seeing the cheshire cat sitting on a bough of a tree a few yards off  the cat only grinned when it saw alice it looked good natured she thought  still it had very long claws and a great many teeth so she felt that it ought to be treated with respect  cheshire puss she began rather timidly as she did not at all know whether it would like the name  however it only grinned a little wider come its pleased so far thought alice and she went on would you tell me please which way i ought to go from here  that depends a good deal on where you want to get to said the cat  i dont much care where  said alice  then it doesnt matter which way you go said the cat   so long as i get somewhere alice added as an explanation  oh youre sure to do that said the cat if you only walk long enough  alice felt that this could not be denied so she tried another question what sort of people live about here  in that direction the cat said waving its right paw round lives a hatter  and in that direction waving the other paw lives a march hare visit either you like  theyre both mad  but i dont want to go among mad people alice remarked  oh you cant help that said the cat  were all mad here im mad youre mad  how do you know im mad said alice  you must be said the cat or you wouldnt have come here  alice didnt think that proved it at all however she went on and how do you know that youre mad  to begin with said the cat a dogs not mad you grant that  i suppose so said alice  well then the cat went on you see a dog growls when its angry and wags its tail when its pleased now i growl when im pleased and wag my tail when im angry therefore im mad  i call it purring not growling said alice  call it what you like said the cat do you play croquet with the queen to day  i should like it very much said alice but i havent been invited yet  youll see me there said the cat and vanished  alice was not much surprised at this she was getting so used to queer things happening while she was looking at the place where it had been it suddenly appeared again  by the bye what became of the baby said the cat id nearly forgotten to ask  it turned into a pig alice quietly said just as if it had come back in a natural way  i thought it would said the cat and vanished again  alice waited a little half expecting to see it again but it did not appear and after a minute or two she walked on in the direction in which the march hare was said to live ive seen hatters before she said to herself the march hare will be much the most interesting and perhaps as this is may it wont be raving mad at least not so mad as it was in march as she said this she looked up and there was the cat again sitting on a branch of a tree  did you say pig or fig said the cat  i said pig replied alice and i wish you wouldnt keep appearing and vanishing so suddenly  you make one quite giddy  all right said the cat and this time it vanished quite slowly beginning with the end of the tail and ending with the grin which remained some time after the rest of it had gone  well ive often seen a cat without a grin thought alice but a grin without a cat its the most curious thing i ever saw in my life  she had not gone much farther before she came in sight of the house of the march hare  she thought it must be the right house because the chimneys were shaped like ears and the roof was thatched with fur it was so large a house that she did not like to go nearer till she had nibbled some more of the lefthand bit of mushroom and raised herself to about two feet high  even then she walked up towards it rather timidly saying to herself suppose it should be raving mad after all i almost wish id gone to see the hatter instead     chapter vii a mad tea party   there was a table set out under a tree in front of the house and the march hare and the hatter were having tea at it  a dormouse was sitting between them fast asleep and the other two were using it as a cushion resting their elbows on it and talking over its head very uncomfortable for the dormouse thought alice only as its asleep i suppose it doesnt mind  the table was a large one but the three were all crowded together at one corner of it  no room no room they cried out when they saw alice coming theres plenty of room said alice indignantly and she sat down in a large arm chair at one end of the table  have some wine the march hare said in an encouraging tone  alice looked all round the table but there was nothing on it but tea i dont see any wine she remarked  there isnt any said the march hare  then it wasnt very civil of you to offer it said alice angrily  it wasnt very civil of you to sit down without being invited said the march hare  i didnt know it was your table said alice its laid for a great many more than three  your hair wants cutting said the hatter he had been looking at alice for some time with great curiosity and this was his first speech  you should learn not to make personal remarks alice said with some severity its very rude  the hatter opened his eyes very wide on hearing this but all he said was why is a raven like a writing desk  come we shall have some fun now thought alice im glad theyve begun asking riddles i believe i can guess that she added aloud  do you mean that you think you can find out the answer to it said the march hare  exactly so said alice  then you should say what you mean the march hare went on  i do alice hastily replied at least at least i mean what i say thats the same thing you know  not the same thing a bit said the hatter you might just as well say that â€˜i see what i eat is the same thing as â€˜i eat what i see  you might just as well say added the march hare that â€˜i like what i get is the same thing as â€˜i get what i like  you might just as well say added the dormouse who seemed to be talking in his sleep that â€˜i breathe when i sleep is the same thing as â€˜i sleep when i breathe  it is the same thing with you said the hatter and here the conversation dropped and the party sat silent for a minute while alice thought over all she could remember about ravens and writing desks which wasnt much  the hatter was the first to break the silence what day of the month is it he said turning to alice  he had taken his watch out of his pocket and was looking at it uneasily shaking it every now and then and holding it to his ear  alice considered a little and then said the fourth  two days wrong sighed the hatter i told you butter wouldnt suit the works he added looking angrily at the march hare  it was the best butter the march hare meekly replied  yes but some crumbs must have got in as well the hatter grumbled  you shouldnt have put it in with the bread knife  the march hare took the watch and looked at it gloomily  then he dipped it into his cup of tea and looked at it again  but he could think of nothing better to say than his first remark it was the best butter you know  alice had been looking over his shoulder with some curiosity what a funny watch she remarked it tells the day of the month and doesnt tell what oclock it is  why should it muttered the hatter does your watch tell you what year it is  of course not alice replied very readily  but thats because it stays the same year for such a long time together  which is just the case with mine said the hatter  alice felt dreadfully puzzled the hatters remark seemed to have no sort of meaning in it and yet it was certainly english i dont quite understand you she said as politely as she could  the dormouse is asleep again said the hatter and he poured a little hot tea upon its nose  the dormouse shook its head impatiently and said without opening its eyes of course of course just what i was going to remark myself  have you guessed the riddle yet the hatter said turning to alice again  no i give it up alice replied  whats the answer  i havent the slightest idea said the hatter  nor i said the march hare  alice sighed wearily i think you might do something better with the time she said than waste it in asking riddles that have no answers  if you knew time as well as i do said the hatter you wouldnt talk about wasting it its him  i dont know what you mean said alice  of course you dont the hatter said tossing his head contemptuously i dare say you never even spoke to time  perhaps not alice cautiously replied  but i know i have to beat time when i learn music  ah that accounts for it said the hatter he wont stand beating now if you only kept on good terms with him hed do almost anything you liked with the clock for instance suppose it were nine oclock in the morning just time to begin lessons  youd only have to whisper a hint to time and round goes the clock in a twinkling half past one time for dinner  i only wish it was the march hare said to itself in a whisper  that would be grand certainly said alice thoughtfully  but then i shouldnt be hungry for it you know  not at first perhaps said the hatter  but you could keep it to half past one as long as you liked  is that the way you manage alice asked  the hatter shook his head mournfully not i he replied we quarrelled last march just before he went mad you know  pointing with his tea spoon at the march hare  it was at the great concert given by the queen of hearts and i had to sing  â€˜twinkle twinkle little bat how i wonder what youre at   you know the song perhaps  ive heard something like it said alice  it goes on you know the hatter continued in this way    â€˜up above the world you fly like a tea tray in the sky                     twinkle twinkle    here the dormouse shook itself and began singing in its sleep twinkle twinkle twinkle twinkle  and went on so long that they had to pinch it to make it stop  well id hardly finished the first verse said the hatter when the queen jumped up and bawled out â€˜hes murdering the time off with his head  how dreadfully savage exclaimed alice  and ever since that the hatter went on in a mournful tone he wont do a thing i ask its always six oclock now  a bright idea came into alices head is that the reason so many tea things are put out here she asked  yes thats it said the hatter with a sigh  its always tea time and weve no time to wash the things between whiles  then you keep moving round i suppose said alice  exactly so said the hatter  as the things get used up  but what happens when you come to the beginning again alice ventured to ask  suppose we change the subject the march hare interrupted yawning im getting tired of this i vote the young lady tells us a story  im afraid i dont know one said alice rather alarmed at the proposal  then the dormouse shall they both cried wake up dormouse and they pinched it on both sides at once  the dormouse slowly opened his eyes i wasnt asleep he said in a hoarse feeble voice  i heard every word you fellows were saying  tell us a story said the march hare  yes please do pleaded alice  and be quick about it added the hatter or youll be asleep again before its done  once upon a time there were three little sisters the dormouse began in a great hurry and their names were elsie lacie and tillie and they lived at the bottom of a well   what did they live on said alice who always took a great interest in questions of eating and drinking  they lived on treacle said the dormouse after thinking a minute or two  they couldnt have done that you know alice gently remarked theyd have been ill  so they were said the dormouse very ill  alice tried to fancy to herself what such an extraordinary way of living would be like but it puzzled her too much so she went on  but why did they live at the bottom of a well  take some more tea the march hare said to alice very earnestly  ive had nothing yet alice replied in an offended tone so i cant take more  you mean you cant take less said the hatter  its very easy to take more than nothing  nobody asked your opinion said alice  whos making personal remarks now the hatter asked triumphantly  alice did not quite know what to say to this  so she helped herself to some tea and bread and butter and then turned to the dormouse and repeated her question why did they live at the bottom of a well  the dormouse again took a minute or two to think about it and then said it was a treacle well  theres no such thing alice was beginning very angrily but the hatter and the march hare went sh sh and the dormouse sulkily remarked if you cant be civil youd better finish the story for yourself  no please go on alice said very humbly i wont interrupt again i dare say there may be one  one indeed said the dormouse indignantly however he consented to go on and so these three little sisters they were learning to draw you know   what did they draw said alice quite forgetting her promise  treacle said the dormouse without considering at all this time  i want a clean cup interrupted the hatter  lets all move one place on  he moved on as he spoke and the dormouse followed him  the march hare moved into the dormouses place and alice rather unwillingly took the place of the march hare the hatter was the only one who got any advantage from the change  and alice was a good deal worse off than before as the march hare had just upset the milk jug into his plate  alice did not wish to offend the dormouse again so she began very cautiously  but i dont understand where did they draw the treacle from  you can draw water out of a water well said the hatter so i should think you could draw treacle out of a treacle well eh stupid  but they were in the well alice said to the dormouse not choosing to notice this last remark  of course they were said the dormouse  well in  this answer so confused poor alice that she let the dormouse go on for some time without interrupting it  they were learning to draw the dormouse went on yawning and rubbing its eyes for it was getting very sleepy and they drew all manner of things everything that begins with an m   why with an m said alice  why not said the march hare  alice was silent  the dormouse had closed its eyes by this time and was going off into a doze but on being pinched by the hatter it woke up again with a little shriek and went on   that begins with an m such as mouse traps and the moon and memory and muchness you know you say things are much of a muchness did you ever see such a thing as a drawing of a muchness  really now you ask me said alice very much confused i dont think   then you shouldnt talk said the hatter  this piece of rudeness was more than alice could bear  she got up in great disgust and walked off the dormouse fell asleep instantly and neither of the others took the least notice of her going though she looked back once or twice half hoping that they would call after her  the last time she saw them they were trying to put the dormouse into the teapot  at any rate ill never go there again said alice as she picked her way through the wood its the stupidest tea party i ever was at in all my life  just as she said this she noticed that one of the trees had a door leading right into it thats very curious she thought but everythings curious today i think i may as well go in at once and in she went  once more she found herself in the long hall and close to the little glass table now ill manage better this time she said to herself and began by taking the little golden key and unlocking the door that led into the garden then she went to work nibbling at the mushroom she had kept a piece of it in her pocket till she was about a foot high  then she walked down the little passage  and then she found herself at last in the beautiful garden among the bright flower beds and the cool fountains     chapter viii the queens croquet ground   a large rose tree stood near the entrance of the garden  the roses growing on it were white but there were three gardeners at it busily painting them red alice thought this a very curious thing and she went nearer to watch them and just as she came up to them she heard one of them say look out now five dont go splashing paint over me like that  i couldnt help it said five in a sulky tone seven jogged my elbow  on which seven looked up and said thats right five always lay the blame on others  youd better not talk said five i heard the queen say only yesterday you deserved to be beheaded  what for said the one who had spoken first  thats none of your business two said seven  yes it is his business said five and ill tell him it was for bringing the cook tulip roots instead of onions  seven flung down his brush and had just begun well of all the unjust things  when his eye chanced to fall upon alice as she stood watching them and he checked himself suddenly  the others looked round also and all of them bowed low  would you tell me said alice a little timidly why you are painting those roses  five and seven said nothing but looked at two two began in a low voice why the fact is you see miss this here ought to have been a red rose tree and we put a white one in by mistake and if the queen was to find it out we should all have our heads cut off you know so you see miss were doing our best afore she comes to  at this moment five who had been anxiously looking across the garden called out the queen the queen and the three gardeners instantly threw themselves flat upon their faces there was a sound of many footsteps and alice looked round eager to see the queen  first came ten soldiers carrying clubs these were all shaped like the three gardeners oblong and flat with their hands and feet at the corners  next the ten courtiers these were ornamented all over with diamonds and walked two and two as the soldiers did after these came the royal children there were ten of them and the little dears came jumping merrily along hand in hand in couples  they were all ornamented with hearts next came the guests mostly kings and queens and among them alice recognised the white rabbit  it was talking in a hurried nervous manner smiling at everything that was said and went by without noticing her then followed the knave of hearts carrying the kings crown on a crimson velvet cushion and last of all this grand procession came the king and queen of hearts  alice was rather doubtful whether she ought not to lie down on her face like the three gardeners but she could not remember ever having heard of such a rule at processions and besides what would be the use of a procession thought she if people had all to lie down upon their faces so that they couldnt see it so she stood still where she was and waited  when the procession came opposite to alice they all stopped and looked at her and the queen said severely who is this she said it to the knave of hearts who only bowed and smiled in reply  idiot said the queen tossing her head impatiently and turning to alice she went on whats your name child  my name is alice so please your majesty said alice very politely but she added to herself why theyre only a pack of cards after all i neednt be afraid of them  and who are these said the queen pointing to the three gardeners who were lying round the rose tree for you see as they were lying on their faces and the pattern on their backs was the same as the rest of the pack she could not tell whether they were gardeners or soldiers or courtiers or three of her own children  how should i know said alice surprised at her own courage its no business of mine  the queen turned crimson with fury and after glaring at her for a moment like a wild beast screamed off with her head off   nonsense said alice very loudly and decidedly and the queen was silent  the king laid his hand upon her arm and timidly said consider my dear  she is only a child  the queen turned angrily away from him and said to the knave turn them over  the knave did so very carefully with one foot  get up said the queen in a shrill loud voice and the three gardeners instantly jumped up and began bowing to the king the queen the royal children and everybody else  leave off that screamed the queen you make me giddy and then turning to the rose tree she went on what have you been doing here  may it please your majesty said two in a very humble tone going down on one knee as he spoke we were trying   i see said the queen who had meanwhile been examining the roses off with their heads and the procession moved on three of the soldiers remaining behind to execute the unfortunate gardeners who ran to alice for protection  you shant be beheaded said alice and she put them into a large flower pot that stood near the three soldiers wandered about for a minute or two looking for them and then quietly marched off after the others  are their heads off shouted the queen  their heads are gone if it please your majesty the soldiers shouted in reply  thats right shouted the queen can you play croquet  the soldiers were silent and looked at alice as the question was evidently meant for her  yes shouted alice  come on then roared the queen and alice joined the procession wondering very much what would happen next  its its a very fine day said a timid voice at her side she was walking by the white rabbit who was peeping anxiously into her face  very said alice   wheres the duchess  hush hush said the rabbit in a low hurried tone he looked anxiously over his shoulder as he spoke and then raised himself upon tiptoe put his mouth close to her ear and whispered shes under sentence of execution  what for said alice  did you say â€˜what a pity the rabbit asked  no i didnt said alice  i dont think its at all a pity i said â€˜what for  she boxed the queens ears  the rabbit began alice gave a little scream of laughter oh hush the rabbit whispered in a frightened tone the queen will hear you you see she came rather late and the queen said   get to your places shouted the queen in a voice of thunder and people began running about in all directions tumbling up against each other however they got settled down in a minute or two and the game began alice thought she had never seen such a curious croquet ground in her life it was all ridges and furrows the balls were live hedgehogs the mallets live flamingoes and the soldiers had to double themselves up and to stand on their hands and feet to make the arches  the chief difficulty alice found at first was in managing her flamingo  she succeeded in getting its body tucked away comfortably enough under her arm with its legs hanging down but generally just as she had got its neck nicely straightened out and was going to give the hedgehog a blow with its head it would twist itself round and look up in her face with such a puzzled expression that she could not help bursting out laughing  and when she had got its head down and was going to begin again it was very provoking to find that the hedgehog had unrolled itself and was in the act of crawling away  besides all this there was generally a ridge or furrow in the way wherever she wanted to send the hedgehog to and as the doubled up soldiers were always getting up and walking off to other parts of the ground alice soon came to the conclusion that it was a very difficult game indeed  the players all played at once without waiting for turns quarrelling all the while and fighting for the hedgehogs and in a very short time the queen was in a furious passion and went stamping about and shouting off with his head or off with her head about once in a minute  alice began to feel very uneasy  to be sure she had not as yet had any dispute with the queen but she knew that it might happen any minute and then thought she what would become of me theyre dreadfully fond of beheading people here the great wonder is that theres any one left alive  she was looking about for some way of escape and wondering whether she could get away without being seen when she noticed a curious appearance in the air  it puzzled her very much at first but after watching it a minute or two she made it out to be a grin and she said to herself its the cheshire cat  now i shall have somebody to talk to  how are you getting on said the cat as soon as there was mouth enough for it to speak with  alice waited till the eyes appeared and then nodded its no use speaking to it she thought till its ears have come or at least one of them in another minute the whole head appeared and then alice put down her flamingo and began an account of the game feeling very glad she had someone to listen to her the cat seemed to think that there was enough of it now in sight and no more of it appeared  i dont think they play at all fairly alice began in rather a complaining tone and they all quarrel so dreadfully one cant hear oneself speak and they dont seem to have any rules in particular at least if there are nobody attends to them and youve no idea how confusing it is all the things being alive for instance theres the arch ive got to go through next walking about at the other end of the ground and i should have croqueted the queens hedgehog just now only it ran away when it saw mine coming  how do you like the queen said the cat in a low voice  not at all said alice  shes so extremely  just then she noticed that the queen was close behind her listening  so she went on  likely to win that its hardly worth while finishing the game  the queen smiled and passed on  who are you talking to said the king going up to alice and looking at the cats head with great curiosity  its a friend of mine a cheshire cat said alice  allow me to introduce it  i dont like the look of it at all said the king  however it may kiss my hand if it likes  id rather not the cat remarked  dont be impertinent said the king and dont look at me like that he got behind alice as he spoke  a cat may look at a king said alice ive read that in some book but i dont remember where  well it must be removed said the king very decidedly and he called the queen who was passing at the moment my dear i wish you would have this cat removed  the queen had only one way of settling all difficulties great or small off with his head she said without even looking round  ill fetch the executioner myself said the king eagerly and he hurried off  alice thought she might as well go back and see how the game was going on as she heard the queens voice in the distance screaming with passion she had already heard her sentence three of the players to be executed for having missed their turns and she did not like the look of things at all as the game was in such confusion that she never knew whether it was her turn or not so she went in search of her hedgehog  the hedgehog was engaged in a fight with another hedgehog which seemed to alice an excellent opportunity for croqueting one of them with the other  the only difficulty was that her flamingo was gone across to the other side of the garden where alice could see it trying in a helpless sort of way to fly up into a tree  by the time she had caught the flamingo and brought it back the fight was over and both the hedgehogs were out of sight  but it doesnt matter much thought alice as all the arches are gone from this side of the ground so she tucked it away under her arm that it might not escape again and went back for a little more conversation with her friend  when she got back to the cheshire cat she was surprised to find quite a large crowd collected round it  there was a dispute going on between the executioner the king and the queen who were all talking at once while all the rest were quite silent and looked very uncomfortable  the moment alice appeared she was appealed to by all three to settle the question and they repeated their arguments to her though as they all spoke at once she found it very hard indeed to make out exactly what they said  the executioners argument was that you couldnt cut off a head unless there was a body to cut it off from  that he had never had to do such a thing before and he wasnt going to begin at his time of life  the kings argument was that anything that had a head could be beheaded and that you werent to talk nonsense  the queens argument was that if something wasnt done about it in less than no time shed have everybody executed all round it was this last remark that had made the whole party look so grave and anxious  alice could think of nothing else to say but it belongs to the duchess  youd better ask her about it  shes in prison the queen said to the executioner  fetch her here and the executioner went off like an arrow  the cats head began fading away the moment he was gone and by the time he had come back with the duchess it had entirely disappeared so the king and the executioner ran wildly up and down looking for it while the rest of the party went back to the game     chapter ix the mock turtles story   you cant think how glad i am to see you again you dear old thing said the duchess as she tucked her arm affectionately into alices and they walked off together  alice was very glad to find her in such a pleasant temper and thought to herself that perhaps it was only the pepper that had made her so savage when they met in the kitchen  when im a duchess she said to herself not in a very hopeful tone though i wont have any pepper in my kitchen at all soup does very well without maybe its always pepper that makes people hot tempered she went on very much pleased at having found out a new kind of rule and vinegar that makes them sour and camomile that makes them bitter and and barley sugar and such things that make children sweet tempered i only wish people knew that  then they wouldnt be so stingy about it you know   she had quite forgotten the duchess by this time and was a little startled when she heard her voice close to her ear youre thinking about something my dear and that makes you forget to talk i cant tell you just now what the moral of that is but i shall remember it in a bit  perhaps it hasnt one alice ventured to remark  tut tut child said the duchess everythings got a moral if only you can find it and she squeezed herself up closer to alices side as she spoke  alice did not much like keeping so close to her  first because the duchess was very ugly and secondly because she was exactly the right height to rest her chin upon alices shoulder and it was an uncomfortably sharp chin however she did not like to be rude so she bore it as well as she could  the games going on rather better now she said by way of keeping up the conversation a little  tis so said the duchess  and the moral of that is â€˜oh tis love tis love that makes the world go round  somebody said alice whispered that its done by everybody minding their own business  ah well it means much the same thing said the duchess digging her sharp little chin into alices shoulder as she added and the moral of that is â€˜take care of the sense and the sounds will take care of themselves  how fond she is of finding morals in things alice thought to herself  i dare say youre wondering why i dont put my arm round your waist the duchess said after a pause  the reason is that im doubtful about the temper of your flamingo shall i try the experiment  he might bite alice cautiously replied not feeling at all anxious to have the experiment tried  very true said the duchess  flamingoes and mustard both bite and the moral of that is â€˜birds of a feather flock together  only mustard isnt a bird alice remarked  right as usual said the duchess  what a clear way you have of putting things  its a mineral i think said alice  of course it is said the duchess who seemed ready to agree to everything that alice said theres a large mustard mine near here and the moral of that is â€˜the more there is of mine the less there is of yours  oh i know exclaimed alice who had not attended to this last remark its a vegetable it doesnt look like one but it is  i quite agree with you said the duchess and the moral of that is â€˜be what you would seem to be or if youd like it put more simply â€˜never imagine yourself not to be otherwise than what it might appear to others that what you were or might have been was not otherwise than what you had been would have appeared to them to be otherwise  i think i should understand that better alice said very politely if i had it written down  but i cant quite follow it as you say it  thats nothing to what i could say if i chose the duchess replied in a pleased tone  pray dont trouble yourself to say it any longer than that said alice  oh dont talk about trouble said the duchess i make you a present of everything ive said as yet  a cheap sort of present thought alice im glad they dont give birthday presents like that but she did not venture to say it out loud  thinking again the duchess asked with another dig of her sharp little chin  ive a right to think said alice sharply for she was beginning to feel a little worried  just about as much right said the duchess as pigs have to fly and the m   but here to alices great surprise the duchesss voice died away even in the middle of her favourite word â€˜moral and the arm that was linked into hers began to tremble alice looked up and there stood the queen in front of them with her arms folded frowning like a thunderstorm  a fine day your majesty the duchess began in a low weak voice  now i give you fair warning shouted the queen stamping on the ground as she spoke either you or your head must be off and that in about half no time take your choice  the duchess took her choice and was gone in a moment  lets go on with the game the queen said to alice and alice was too much frightened to say a word but slowly followed her back to the croquet ground  the other guests had taken advantage of the queens absence and were resting in the shade  however the moment they saw her they hurried back to the game the queen merely remarking that a moments delay would cost them their lives  all the time they were playing the queen never left off quarrelling with the other players and shouting off with his head or off with her head those whom she sentenced were taken into custody by the soldiers who of course had to leave off being arches to do this so that by the end of half an hour or so there were no arches left and all the players except the king the queen and alice were in custody and under sentence of execution  then the queen left off quite out of breath and said to alice have you seen the mock turtle yet  no said alice i dont even know what a mock turtle is  its the thing mock turtle soup is made from said the queen  i never saw one or heard of one said alice  come on then said the queen and he shall tell you his history  as they walked off together alice heard the king say in a low voice to the company generally you are all pardoned come thats a good thing she said to herself for she had felt quite unhappy at the number of executions the queen had ordered  they very soon came upon a gryphon lying fast asleep in the sun if you dont know what a gryphon is look at the picture up lazy thing said the queen and take this young lady to see the mock turtle and to hear his history i must go back and see after some executions i have ordered and she walked off leaving alice alone with the gryphon alice did not quite like the look of the creature but on the whole she thought it would be quite as safe to stay with it as to go after that savage queen  so she waited  the gryphon sat up and rubbed its eyes  then it watched the queen till she was out of sight  then it chuckled what fun said the gryphon half to itself half to alice  what is the fun said alice  why she said the gryphon its all her fancy that  they never executes nobody you know come on  everybody says â€˜come on here thought alice as she went slowly after it  i never was so ordered about in all my life never  they had not gone far before they saw the mock turtle in the distance sitting sad and lonely on a little ledge of rock and as they came nearer alice could hear him sighing as if his heart would break she pitied him deeply what is his sorrow she asked the gryphon and the gryphon answered very nearly in the same words as before its all his fancy that  he hasnt got no sorrow you know come on  so they went up to the mock turtle who looked at them with large eyes full of tears but said nothing  this here young lady said the gryphon she wants for to know your history she do  ill tell it her said the mock turtle in a deep hollow tone  sit down both of you and dont speak a word till ive finished  so they sat down and nobody spoke for some minutes alice thought to herself i dont see how he can ever finish if he doesnt begin but she waited patiently  once said the mock turtle at last with a deep sigh i was a real turtle  these words were followed by a very long silence broken only by an occasional exclamation of hjckrrh from the gryphon and the constant heavy sobbing of the mock turtle alice was very nearly getting up and saying thank you sir for your interesting story but she could not help thinking there must be more to come so she sat still and said nothing  when we were little the mock turtle went on at last more calmly though still sobbing a little now and then we went to school in the sea the master was an old turtle we used to call him tortoise   why did you call him tortoise if he wasnt one alice asked  we called him tortoise because he taught us said the mock turtle angrily  really you are very dull  you ought to be ashamed of yourself for asking such a simple question added the gryphon and then they both sat silent and looked at poor alice who felt ready to sink into the earth at last the gryphon said to the mock turtle drive on old fellow dont be all day about it and he went on in these words   yes we went to school in the sea though you maynt believe it   i never said i didnt interrupted alice  you did said the mock turtle  hold your tongue added the gryphon before alice could speak again the mock turtle went on  we had the best of educations in fact we went to school every day   ive been to a day school too said alice you neednt be so proud as all that  with extras asked the mock turtle a little anxiously  yes said alice we learned french and music  and washing said the mock turtle  certainly not said alice indignantly  ah then yours wasnt a really good school said the mock turtle in a tone of great relief now at ours they had at the end of the bill â€˜french music and washing extra  you couldnt have wanted it much said alice living at the bottom of the sea  i couldnt afford to learn it said the mock turtle with a sigh i only took the regular course  what was that inquired alice  reeling and writhing of course to begin with the mock turtle replied and then the different branches of arithmetic ambition distraction uglification and derision  i never heard of â€˜uglification alice ventured to say what is it  the gryphon lifted up both its paws in surprise what never heard of uglifying it exclaimed you know what to beautify is i suppose  yes said alice doubtfully  it means to make anything prettier  well then the gryphon went on if you dont know what to uglify is you are a simpleton  alice did not feel encouraged to ask any more questions about it so she turned to the mock turtle and said what else had you to learn  well there was mystery the mock turtle replied counting off the subjects on his flappers  mystery ancient and modern with seaography  then drawling the drawling master was an old conger eel that used to come once a week  he taught us drawling stretching and fainting in coils  what was that like said alice  well i cant show it you myself the mock turtle said  im too stiff and the gryphon never learnt it  hadnt time said the gryphon  i went to the classics master though he was an old crab he was  i never went to him the mock turtle said with a sigh  he taught laughing and grief they used to say  so he did so he did said the gryphon sighing in his turn and both creatures hid their faces in their paws  and how many hours a day did you do lessons said alice in a hurry to change the subject  ten hours the first day said the mock turtle  nine the next and so on  what a curious plan exclaimed alice  thats the reason theyre called lessons the gryphon remarked  because they lessen from day to day  this was quite a new idea to alice and she thought it over a little before she made her next remark then the eleventh day must have been a holiday  of course it was said the mock turtle  and how did you manage on the twelfth alice went on eagerly  thats enough about lessons the gryphon interrupted in a very decided tone  tell her something about the games now     chapter x the lobster quadrille   the mock turtle sighed deeply and drew the back of one flapper across his eyes he looked at alice and tried to speak but for a minute or two sobs choked his voice same as if he had a bone in his throat said the gryphon  and it set to work shaking him and punching him in the back at last the mock turtle recovered his voice and with tears running down his cheeks he went on again    you may not have lived much under the sea  i havent said alice and perhaps you were never even introduced to a lobster  alice began to say i once tasted  but checked herself hastily and said no never  so you can have no idea what a delightful thing a lobster quadrille is  no indeed said alice what sort of a dance is it  why said the gryphon you first form into a line along the sea shore   two lines cried the mock turtle seals turtles salmon and so on then when youve cleared all the jelly fish out of the way   that generally takes some time interrupted the gryphon   you advance twice   each with a lobster as a partner cried the gryphon  of course the mock turtle said  advance twice set to partners    change lobsters and retire in same order continued the gryphon  then you know the mock turtle went on you throw the   the lobsters shouted the gryphon with a bound into the air   as far out to sea as you can   swim after them screamed the gryphon  turn a somersault in the sea cried the mock turtle capering wildly about  change lobsters again yelled the gryphon at the top of its voice  back to land again and thats all the first figure said the mock turtle suddenly dropping his voice and the two creatures who had been jumping about like mad things all this time sat down again very sadly and quietly and looked at alice  it must be a very pretty dance said alice timidly  would you like to see a little of it said the mock turtle  very much indeed said alice  come lets try the first figure said the mock turtle to the gryphon we can do without lobsters you know which shall sing  oh you sing said the gryphon ive forgotten the words  so they began solemnly dancing round and round alice every now and then treading on her toes when they passed too close and waving their forepaws to mark the time while the mock turtle sang this very slowly and sadly    will you walk a little faster said a whiting to a snail theres a porpoise close behind us and hes treading on my tail see how eagerly the lobsters and the turtles all advance they are waiting on the shingle will you come and join the dance will you wont you will you wont you will you join the dance will you wont you will you wont you wont you join the dance  you can really have no notion how delightful it will be when they take us up and throw us with the lobsters out to sea but the snail replied too far too far and gave a look askance  said he thanked the whiting kindly but he would not join the dance would not could not would not could not would not join the dance would not could not would not could not could not join the dance  what matters it how far we go his scaly friend replied there is another shore you know upon the other side the further off from england the nearer is to france  then turn not pale beloved snail but come and join the dance will you wont you will you wont you will you join the dance will you wont you will you wont you wont you join the dance   thank you its a very interesting dance to watch said alice feeling very glad that it was over at last  and i do so like that curious song about the whiting  oh as to the whiting said the mock turtle they youve seen them of course  yes said alice ive often seen them at dinn  she checked herself hastily  i dont know where dinn may be said the mock turtle but if youve seen them so often of course you know what theyre like  i believe so alice replied thoughtfully they have their tails in their mouths and theyre all over crumbs  youre wrong about the crumbs said the mock turtle  crumbs would all wash off in the sea but they have their tails in their mouths and the reason is  here the mock turtle yawned and shut his eyes tell her about the reason and all that he said to the gryphon  the reason is said the gryphon that they would go with the lobsters to the dance so they got thrown out to sea so they had to fall a long way so they got their tails fast in their mouths so they couldnt get them out again thats all  thank you said alice its very interesting i never knew so much about a whiting before  i can tell you more than that if you like said the gryphon do you know why its called a whiting  i never thought about it said alice why  it does the boots and shoes the gryphon replied very solemnly  alice was thoroughly puzzled does the boots and shoes she repeated in a wondering tone  why what are your shoes done with said the gryphon i mean what makes them so shiny  alice looked down at them and considered a little before she gave her answer theyre done with blacking i believe  boots and shoes under the sea the gryphon went on in a deep voice are done with a whiting now you know  and what are they made of alice asked in a tone of great curiosity  soles and eels of course the gryphon replied rather impatiently  any shrimp could have told you that  if id been the whiting said alice whose thoughts were still running on the song id have said to the porpoise â€˜keep back please  we dont want you with us  they were obliged to have him with them the mock turtle said  no wise fish would go anywhere without a porpoise  wouldnt it really said alice in a tone of great surprise  of course not said the mock turtle  why if a fish came to me and told me he was going a journey i should say â€˜with what porpoise  dont you mean â€˜purpose said alice  i mean what i say the mock turtle replied in an offended tone and the gryphon added come lets hear some of your adventures  i could tell you my adventures beginning from this morning said alice a little timidly  but its no use going back to yesterday because i was a different person then  explain all that said the mock turtle  no no the adventures first said the gryphon in an impatient tone  explanations take such a dreadful time  so alice began telling them her adventures from the time when she first saw the white rabbit she was a little nervous about it just at first the two creatures got so close to her one on each side and opened their eyes and mouths so very wide but she gained courage as she went on her listeners were perfectly quiet till she got to the part about her repeating you are old father william to the caterpillar and the words all coming different and then the mock turtle drew a long breath and said thats very curious  its all about as curious as it can be said the gryphon  it all came different the mock turtle repeated thoughtfully i should like to hear her try and repeat something now tell her to begin he looked at the gryphon as if he thought it had some kind of authority over alice  stand up and repeat â€˜tis the voice of the sluggard said the gryphon  how the creatures order one about and make one repeat lessons thought alice i might as well be at school at once however she got up and began to repeat it but her head was so full of the lobster quadrille that she hardly knew what she was saying and the words came very queer indeed    tis the voice of the lobster i heard him declare you have baked me too brown i must sugar my hair as a duck with its eyelids so he with his nose trims his belt and his buttons and turns out his toes  later editions continued as follows when the sands are all dry he is gay as a lark and will talk in contemptuous tones of the shark but when the tide rises and sharks are around his voice has a timid and tremulous sound   thats different from what i used to say when i was a child said the gryphon  well i never heard it before said the mock turtle but it sounds uncommon nonsense  alice said nothing she had sat down with her face in her hands wondering if anything would ever happen in a natural way again  i should like to have it explained said the mock turtle  she cant explain it said the gryphon hastily go on with the next verse  but about his toes the mock turtle persisted how could he turn them out with his nose you know  its the first position in dancing alice said but was dreadfully puzzled by the whole thing and longed to change the subject  go on with the next verse the gryphon repeated impatiently  it begins â€˜i passed by his garden  alice did not dare to disobey though she felt sure it would all come wrong and she went on in a trembling voice    i passed by his garden and marked with one eye how the owl and the panther were sharing a pie   later editions continued as follows the panther took pie crust and gravy and meat while the owl had the dish as its share of the treat when the pie was all finished the owl as a boon was kindly permitted to pocket the spoon  while the panther received knife and fork with a growl and concluded the banquet    what is the use of repeating all that stuff the mock turtle interrupted if you dont explain it as you go on its by far the most confusing thing i ever heard  yes i think youd better leave off said the gryphon  and alice was only too glad to do so  shall we try another figure of the lobster quadrille the gryphon went on or would you like the mock turtle to sing you a song  oh a song please if the mock turtle would be so kind alice replied so eagerly that the gryphon said in a rather offended tone hm no accounting for tastes sing her â€˜turtle soup will you old fellow  the mock turtle sighed deeply and began in a voice sometimes choked with sobs to sing this    beautiful soup so rich and green waiting in a hot tureen who for such dainties would not stoop soup of the evening beautiful soup soup of the evening beautiful soup     beau ootiful soo oop     beau ootiful soo oop soo oop of the e e evening     beautiful beautiful soup  beautiful soup who cares for fish game or any other dish who would not give all else for two p ennyworth only of beautiful soup pennyworth only of beautiful soup     beau ootiful soo oop     beau ootiful soo oop soo oop of the e e evening     beautiful beauti ful soup   chorus again cried the gryphon and the mock turtle had just begun to repeat it when a cry of the trials beginning was heard in the distance  come on cried the gryphon and taking alice by the hand it hurried off without waiting for the end of the song  what trial is it alice panted as she ran but the gryphon only answered come on and ran the faster while more and more faintly came carried on the breeze that followed them the melancholy words    soo oop of the e e evening     beautiful beautiful soup     chapter xi who stole the tarts   the king and queen of hearts were seated on their throne when they arrived with a great crowd assembled about them all sorts of little birds and beasts as well as the whole pack of cards  the knave was standing before them in chains with a soldier on each side to guard him and near the king was the white rabbit with a trumpet in one hand and a scroll of parchment in the other in the very middle of the court was a table with a large dish of tarts upon it  they looked so good that it made alice quite hungry to look at them i wish theyd get the trial done she thought and hand round the refreshments but there seemed to be no chance of this so she began looking at everything about her to pass away the time  alice had never been in a court of justice before but she had read about them in books and she was quite pleased to find that she knew the name of nearly everything there thats the judge she said to herself because of his great wig  the judge by the way was the king and as he wore his crown over the wig look at the frontispiece if you want to see how he did it he did not look at all comfortable and it was certainly not becoming  and thats the jury box thought alice and those twelve creatures she was obliged to say creatures you see because some of them were animals and some were birds i suppose they are the jurors she said this last word two or three times over to herself being rather proud of it  for she thought and rightly too that very few little girls of her age knew the meaning of it at all however jury men would have done just as well  the twelve jurors were all writing very busily on slates what are they doing alice whispered to the gryphon they cant have anything to put down yet before the trials begun  theyre putting down their names the gryphon whispered in reply for fear they should forget them before the end of the trial  stupid things alice began in a loud indignant voice but she stopped hastily for the white rabbit cried out silence in the court and the king put on his spectacles and looked anxiously round to make out who was talking  alice could see as well as if she were looking over their shoulders that all the jurors were writing down stupid things on their slates and she could even make out that one of them didnt know how to spell stupid and that he had to ask his neighbour to tell him a nice muddle their slatesll be in before the trials over thought alice  one of the jurors had a pencil that squeaked this of course alice could not stand and she went round the court and got behind him and very soon found an opportunity of taking it away she did it so quickly that the poor little juror it was bill the lizard could not make out at all what had become of it so after hunting all about for it he was obliged to write with one finger for the rest of the day and this was of very little use as it left no mark on the slate  herald read the accusation said the king  on this the white rabbit blew three blasts on the trumpet and then unrolled the parchment scroll and read as follows    the queen of hearts she made some tarts     all on a summer day  the knave of hearts he stole those tarts     and took them quite away   consider your verdict the king said to the jury  not yet not yet the rabbit hastily interrupted theres a great deal to come before that  call the first witness said the king and the white rabbit blew three blasts on the trumpet and called out first witness  the first witness was the hatter he came in with a teacup in one hand and a piece of bread and butter in the other i beg pardon your majesty he began for bringing these in  but i hadnt quite finished my tea when i was sent for  you ought to have finished said the king when did you begin  the hatter looked at the march hare who had followed him into the court arm in arm with the dormouse fourteenth of march i think it was he said  fifteenth said the march hare  sixteenth added the dormouse  write that down the king said to the jury and the jury eagerly wrote down all three dates on their slates and then added them up and reduced the answer to shillings and pence  take off your hat the king said to the hatter  it isnt mine said the hatter  stolen the king exclaimed turning to the jury who instantly made a memorandum of the fact  i keep them to sell the hatter added as an explanation ive none of my own im a hatter  here the queen put on her spectacles and began staring at the hatter who turned pale and fidgeted  give your evidence said the king and dont be nervous or ill have you executed on the spot  this did not seem to encourage the witness at all  he kept shifting from one foot to the other looking uneasily at the queen and in his confusion he bit a large piece out of his teacup instead of the bread and butter  just at this moment alice felt a very curious sensation which puzzled her a good deal until she made out what it was  she was beginning to grow larger again and she thought at first she would get up and leave the court but on second thoughts she decided to remain where she was as long as there was room for her  i wish you wouldnt squeeze so said the dormouse who was sitting next to her i can hardly breathe  i cant help it said alice very meekly  im growing  youve no right to grow here said the dormouse  dont talk nonsense said alice more boldly  you know youre growing too  yes but i grow at a reasonable pace said the dormouse  not in that ridiculous fashion and he got up very sulkily and crossed over to the other side of the court  all this time the queen had never left off staring at the hatter and just as the dormouse crossed the court she said to one of the officers of the court bring me the list of the singers in the last concert on which the wretched hatter trembled so that he shook both his shoes off  give your evidence the king repeated angrily or ill have you executed whether youre nervous or not  im a poor man your majesty the hatter began in a trembling voice  and i hadnt begun my tea not above a week or so and what with the bread and butter getting so thin and the twinkling of the tea   the twinkling of the what said the king  it began with the tea the hatter replied  of course twinkling begins with a t said the king sharply do you take me for a dunce go on  im a poor man the hatter went on and most things twinkled after that only the march hare said   i didnt the march hare interrupted in a great hurry  you did said the hatter  i deny it said the march hare  he denies it said the king  leave out that part  well at any rate the dormouse said  the hatter went on looking anxiously round to see if he would deny it too  but the dormouse denied nothing being fast asleep  after that continued the hatter i cut some more bread and butter   but what did the dormouse say one of the jury asked  that i cant remember said the hatter  you must remember remarked the king or ill have you executed  the miserable hatter dropped his teacup and bread and butter and went down on one knee im a poor man your majesty he began  youre a very poor speaker said the king  here one of the guinea pigs cheered and was immediately suppressed by the officers of the court as that is rather a hard word i will just explain to you how it was done they had a large canvas bag which tied up at the mouth with strings  into this they slipped the guinea pig head first and then sat upon it  im glad ive seen that done thought alice ive so often read in the newspapers at the end of trials there was some attempts at applause which was immediately suppressed by the officers of the court and i never understood what it meant till now  if thats all you know about it you may stand down continued the king  i cant go no lower said the hatter  im on the floor as it is  then you may sit down the king replied  here the other guinea pig cheered and was suppressed  come that finished the guinea pigs thought alice now we shall get on better  id rather finish my tea said the hatter with an anxious look at the queen who was reading the list of singers  you may go said the king and the hatter hurriedly left the court without even waiting to put his shoes on   and just take his head off outside the queen added to one of the officers  but the hatter was out of sight before the officer could get to the door  call the next witness said the king  the next witness was the duchesss cook she carried the pepper box in her hand and alice guessed who it was even before she got into the court by the way the people near the door began sneezing all at once  give your evidence said the king  shant said the cook  the king looked anxiously at the white rabbit who said in a low voice your majesty must cross examine this witness  well if i must i must the king said with a melancholy air and after folding his arms and frowning at the cook till his eyes were nearly out of sight he said in a deep voice what are tarts made of  pepper mostly said the cook  treacle said a sleepy voice behind her  collar that dormouse the queen shrieked out behead that dormouse turn that dormouse out of court suppress him pinch him off with his whiskers  for some minutes the whole court was in confusion getting the dormouse turned out and by the time they had settled down again the cook had disappeared  never mind said the king with an air of great relief call the next witness and he added in an undertone to the queen really my dear you must cross examine the next witness it quite makes my forehead ache  alice watched the white rabbit as he fumbled over the list feeling very curious to see what the next witness would be like  for they havent got much evidence yet she said to herself imagine her surprise when the white rabbit read out at the top of his shrill little voice the name alice     chapter xii alices evidence   here cried alice quite forgetting in the flurry of the moment how large she had grown in the last few minutes and she jumped up in such a hurry that she tipped over the jury box with the edge of her skirt upsetting all the jurymen on to the heads of the crowd below and there they lay sprawling about reminding her very much of a globe of goldfish she had accidentally upset the week before  oh i beg your pardon she exclaimed in a tone of great dismay and began picking them up again as quickly as she could for the accident of the goldfish kept running in her head and she had a vague sort of idea that they must be collected at once and put back into the jury box or they would die  the trial cannot proceed said the king in a very grave voice until all the jurymen are back in their proper places all he repeated with great emphasis looking hard at alice as he said so  alice looked at the jury box and saw that in her haste she had put the lizard in head downwards and the poor little thing was waving its tail about in a melancholy way being quite unable to move she soon got it out again and put it right not that it signifies much she said to herself i should think it would be quite as much use in the trial one way up as the other  as soon as the jury had a little recovered from the shock of being upset and their slates and pencils had been found and handed back to them they set to work very diligently to write out a history of the accident all except the lizard who seemed too much overcome to do anything but sit with its mouth open gazing up into the roof of the court  what do you know about this business the king said to alice  nothing said alice  nothing whatever persisted the king  nothing whatever said alice  thats very important the king said turning to the jury they were just beginning to write this down on their slates when the white rabbit interrupted  unimportant your majesty means of course he said in a very respectful tone but frowning and making faces at him as he spoke  unimportant of course i meant the king hastily said and went on to himself in an undertone  important unimportant unimportant important  as if he were trying which word sounded best  some of the jury wrote it down important and some unimportant alice could see this as she was near enough to look over their slates but it doesnt matter a bit she thought to herself  at this moment the king who had been for some time busily writing in his note book cackled out silence and read out from his book rule forty two all persons more than a mile high to leave the court  everybody looked at alice  im not a mile high said alice  you are said the king  nearly two miles high added the queen  well i shant go at any rate said alice  besides thats not a regular rule  you invented it just now  its the oldest rule in the book said the king  then it ought to be number one said alice  the king turned pale and shut his note book hastily consider your verdict he said to the jury in a low trembling voice  theres more evidence to come yet please your majesty said the white rabbit jumping up in a great hurry this paper has just been picked up  whats in it said the queen  i havent opened it yet said the white rabbit but it seems to be a letter written by the prisoner to to somebody  it must have been that said the king unless it was written to nobody which isnt usual you know  who is it directed to said one of the jurymen  it isnt directed at all said the white rabbit in fact theres nothing written on the outside he unfolded the paper as he spoke and added it isnt a letter after all  its a set of verses  are they in the prisoners handwriting asked another of the jurymen  no theyre not said the white rabbit and thats the queerest thing about it the jury all looked puzzled  he must have imitated somebody elses hand said the king the jury all brightened up again  please your majesty said the knave i didnt write it and they cant prove i did  theres no name signed at the end  if you didnt sign it said the king that only makes the matter worse you must have meant some mischief or else youd have signed your name like an honest man  there was a general clapping of hands at this  it was the first really clever thing the king had said that day  that proves his guilt said the queen  it proves nothing of the sort said alice why you dont even know what theyre about  read them said the king  the white rabbit put on his spectacles where shall i begin please your majesty he asked  begin at the beginning the king said gravely and go on till you come to the end  then stop  these were the verses the white rabbit read    they told me you had been to her     and mentioned me to him  she gave me a good character     but said i could not swim  he sent them word i had not gone     we know it to be true  if she should push the matter on     what would become of you  i gave her one they gave him two     you gave us three or more they all returned from him to you     though they were mine before  if i or she should chance to be     involved in this affair he trusts to you to set them free     exactly as we were  my notion was that you had been     before she had this fit an obstacle that came between     him and ourselves and it  dont let him know she liked them best     for this must ever be a secret kept from all the rest     between yourself and me   thats the most important piece of evidence weve heard yet said the king rubbing his hands so now let the jury   if any one of them can explain it said alice she had grown so large in the last few minutes that she wasnt a bit afraid of interrupting him ill give him sixpence i dont believe theres an atom of meaning in it  the jury all wrote down on their slates she doesnt believe theres an atom of meaning in it but none of them attempted to explain the paper  if theres no meaning in it said the king that saves a world of trouble you know as we neednt try to find any and yet i dont know he went on spreading out the verses on his knee and looking at them with one eye i seem to see some meaning in them after all  said i could not swim  you cant swim can you he added turning to the knave  the knave shook his head sadly do i look like it he said which he certainly did not being made entirely of cardboard  all right so far said the king and he went on muttering over the verses to himself  â€˜we know it to be true  thats the jury of course â€˜i gave her one they gave him two  why that must be what he did with the tarts you know   but it goes on â€˜they all returned from him to you said alice  why there they are said the king triumphantly pointing to the tarts on the table nothing can be clearer than that then again â€˜before she had this fit  you never had fits my dear i think he said to the queen  never said the queen furiously throwing an inkstand at the lizard as she spoke the unfortunate little bill had left off writing on his slate with one finger as he found it made no mark but he now hastily began again using the ink that was trickling down his face as long as it lasted  then the words dont fit you said the king looking round the court with a smile there was a dead silence  its a pun the king added in an offended tone and everybody laughed let the jury consider their verdict the king said for about the twentieth time that day  no no said the queen sentence first verdict afterwards  stuff and nonsense said alice loudly the idea of having the sentence first  hold your tongue said the queen turning purple  i wont said alice  off with her head the queen shouted at the top of her voice nobody moved  who cares for you said alice she had grown to her full size by this time youre nothing but a pack of cards  at this the whole pack rose up into the air and came flying down upon her  she gave a little scream half of fright and half of anger and tried to beat them off and found herself lying on the bank with her head in the lap of her sister who was gently brushing away some dead leaves that had fluttered down from the trees upon her face  wake up alice dear said her sister why what a long sleep youve had  oh ive had such a curious dream said alice and she told her sister as well as she could remember them all these strange adventures of hers that you have just been reading about and when she had finished her sister kissed her and said it was a curious dream dear certainly  but now run in to your tea its getting late so alice got up and ran off thinking while she ran as well she might what a wonderful dream it had been   but her sister sat still just as she left her leaning her head on her hand watching the setting sun and thinking of little alice and all her wonderful adventures till she too began dreaming after a fashion and this was her dream    first she dreamed of little alice herself and once again the tiny hands were clasped upon her knee and the bright eager eyes were looking up into hers she could hear the very tones of her voice and see that queer little toss of her head to keep back the wandering hair that would always get into her eyes and still as she listened or seemed to listen the whole place around her became alive with the strange creatures of her little sisters dream  the long grass rustled at her feet as the white rabbit hurried by the frightened mouse splashed his way through the neighbouring pool she could hear the rattle of the teacups as the march hare and his friends shared their never ending meal and the shrill voice of the queen ordering off her unfortunate guests to execution once more the pig baby was sneezing on the duchesss knee while plates and dishes crashed around it once more the shriek of the gryphon the squeaking of the lizards slate pencil and the choking of the suppressed guinea pigs filled the air mixed up with the distant sobs of the miserable mock turtle  so she sat on with closed eyes and half believed herself in wonderland though she knew she had but to open them again and all would change to dull reality the grass would be only rustling in the wind and the pool rippling to the waving of the reeds the rattling teacups would change to tinkling sheep bells and the queens shrill cries to the voice of the shepherd boy and the sneeze of the baby the shriek of the gryphon and all the other queer noises would change she knew to the confused clamour of the busy farm yard while the lowing of the cattle in the distance would take the place of the mock turtles heavy sobs  lastly she pictured to herself how this same little sister of hers would in the after time be herself a grown woman and how she would keep through all her riper years the simple and loving heart of her childhood  and how she would gather about her other little children and make their eyes bright and eager with many a strange tale perhaps even with the dream of wonderland of long ago  and how she would feel with all their simple sorrows and find a pleasure in all their simple joys remembering her own child life and the happy summer days"@"alice in wonderland"@"lewis carroll"

chapter vi humpty dumpty   chapter vii the lion and the unicorn   chapter viii its my own invention   chapter ix queen alice   chapter x shaking   chapter xi waking   chapter xii which dreamed it     chapter i looking glass house   one thing was certain that the white kitten had had nothing to do with it  it was the black kittens fault entirely for the white kitten had been having its face washed by the old cat for the last quarter of an hour and bearing it pretty well considering so you see that it couldnt have had any hand in the mischief  the way dinah washed her childrens faces was this  first she held the poor thing down by its ear with one paw and then with the other paw she rubbed its face all over the wrong way beginning at the nose  and just now as i said she was hard at work on the white kitten which was lying quite still and trying to purr no doubt feeling that it was all meant for its good  but the black kitten had been finished with earlier in the afternoon and so while alice was sitting curled up in a corner of the great arm chair half talking to herself and half asleep the kitten had been having a grand game of romps with the ball of worsted alice had been trying to wind up and had been rolling it up and down till it had all come undone again and there it was spread over the hearth rug all knots and tangles with the kitten running after its own tail in the middle  oh you wicked little thing cried alice catching up the kitten and giving it a little kiss to make it understand that it was in disgrace really dinah ought to have taught you better manners you ought dinah you know you ought she added looking reproachfully at the old cat and speaking in as cross a voice as she could manage and then she scrambled back into the arm chair taking the kitten and the worsted with her and began winding up the ball again but she didnt get on very fast as she was talking all the time sometimes to the kitten and sometimes to herself kitty sat very demurely on her knee pretending to watch the progress of the winding and now and then putting out one paw and gently touching the ball as if it would be glad to help if it might  do you know what to morrow is kitty alice began youd have guessed if youd been up in the window with me only dinah was making you tidy so you couldnt i was watching the boys getting in sticks for the bonfire and it wants plenty of sticks kitty only it got so cold and it snowed so they had to leave off never mind kitty well go and see the bonfire to morrow here alice wound two or three turns of the worsted round the kittens neck just to see how it would look  this led to a scramble in which the ball rolled down upon the floor and yards and yards of it got unwound again  do you know i was so angry kitty alice went on as soon as they were comfortably settled again when i saw all the mischief you had been doing i was very nearly opening the window and putting you out into the snow and youd have deserved it you little mischievous darling what have you got to say for yourself now dont interrupt me she went on holding up one finger im going to tell you all your faults number one  you squeaked twice while dinah was washing your face this morning now you cant deny it kitty  i heard you whats that you say pretending that the kitten was speaking her paw went into your eye well thats your fault for keeping your eyes open if youd shut them tight up it wouldnt have happened now dont make any more excuses but listen number two  you pulled snowdrop away by the tail just as i had put down the saucer of milk before her what you were thirsty were you how do you know she wasnt thirsty too now for number three  you unwound every bit of the worsted while i wasnt looking  thats three faults kitty and youve not been punished for any of them yet you know im saving up all your punishments for wednesday week suppose they had saved up all my punishments she went on talking more to herself than the kitten what would they do at the end of a year i should be sent to prison i suppose when the day came or let me see suppose each punishment was to be going without a dinner  then when the miserable day came i should have to go without fifty dinners at once well i shouldnt mind that much id far rather go without them than eat them  do you hear the snow against the window panes kitty how nice and soft it sounds just as if some one was kissing the window all over outside i wonder if the snow loves the trees and fields that it kisses them so gently and then it covers them up snug you know with a white quilt and perhaps it says â€˜go to sleep darlings till the summer comes again and when they wake up in the summer kitty they dress themselves all in green and dance about whenever the wind blows oh thats very pretty cried alice dropping the ball of worsted to clap her hands and i do so wish it was true im sure the woods look sleepy in the autumn when the leaves are getting brown  kitty can you play chess now dont smile my dear im asking it seriously because when we were playing just now you watched just as if you understood it  and when i said â€˜check you purred well it was a nice check kitty and really i might have won if it hadnt been for that nasty knight that came wiggling down among my pieces kitty dear lets pretend  and here i wish i could tell you half the things alice used to say beginning with her favourite phrase lets pretend she had had quite a long argument with her sister only the day before all because alice had begun with lets pretend were kings and queens and her sister who liked being very exact had argued that they couldnt because there were only two of them and alice had been reduced at last to say well you can be one of them then and ill be all the rest and once she had really frightened her old nurse by shouting suddenly in her ear nurse do lets pretend that im a hungry hyaena and youre a bone  but this is taking us away from alices speech to the kitten lets pretend that youre the red queen kitty do you know i think if you sat up and folded your arms youd look exactly like her now do try theres a dear and alice got the red queen off the table and set it up before the kitten as a model for it to imitate  however the thing didnt succeed principally alice said because the kitten wouldnt fold its arms properly so to punish it she held it up to the looking glass that it might see how sulky it was and if youre not good directly she added ill put you through into looking glass house how would you like that  now if youll only attend kitty and not talk so much ill tell you all my ideas about looking glass house first theres the room you can see through the glass thats just the same as our drawing room only the things go the other way i can see all of it when i get upon a chair all but the bit behind the fireplace oh i do so wish i could see that bit i want so much to know whether theyve a fire in the winter  you never can tell you know unless our fire smokes and then smoke comes up in that room too but that may be only pretence just to make it look as if they had a fire well then the books are something like our books only the words go the wrong way i know that because ive held up one of our books to the glass and then they hold up one in the other room  how would you like to live in looking glass house kitty i wonder if theyd give you milk in there perhaps looking glass milk isnt good to drink but oh kitty now we come to the passage you can just see a little peep of the passage in looking glass house if you leave the door of our drawing room wide open  and its very like our passage as far as you can see only you know it may be quite different on beyond oh kitty how nice it would be if we could only get through into looking glass house im sure its got oh such beautiful things in it lets pretend theres a way of getting through into it somehow kitty lets pretend the glass has got all soft like gauze so that we can get through why its turning into a sort of mist now i declare itll be easy enough to get through  she was up on the chimney piece while she said this though she hardly knew how she had got there and certainly the glass was beginning to melt away just like a bright silvery mist  in another moment alice was through the glass and had jumped lightly down into the looking glass room the very first thing she did was to look whether there was a fire in the fireplace and she was quite pleased to find that there was a real one blazing away as brightly as the one she had left behind so i shall be as warm here as i was in the old room thought alice  warmer in fact because therell be no one here to scold me away from the fire oh what fun itll be when they see me through the glass in here and cant get at me  then she began looking about and noticed that what could be seen from the old room was quite common and uninteresting but that all the rest was as different as possible for instance the pictures on the wall next the fire seemed to be all alive and the very clock on the chimney piece you know you can only see the back of it in the looking glass had got the face of a little old man and grinned at her  they dont keep this room so tidy as the other alice thought to herself as she noticed several of the chessmen down in the hearth among the cinders  but in another moment with a little oh of surprise she was down on her hands and knees watching them the chessmen were walking about two and two  here are the red king and the red queen alice said in a whisper for fear of frightening them and there are the white king and the white queen sitting on the edge of the shovel and here are two castles walking arm in arm i dont think they can hear me she went on as she put her head closer down and im nearly sure they cant see me i feel somehow as if i were invisible   here something began squeaking on the table behind alice and made her turn her head just in time to see one of the white pawns roll over and begin kicking  she watched it with great curiosity to see what would happen next  it is the voice of my child the white queen cried out as she rushed past the king so violently that she knocked him over among the cinders my precious lily my imperial kitten and she began scrambling wildly up the side of the fender  imperial fiddlestick said the king rubbing his nose which had been hurt by the fall he had a right to be a little annoyed with the queen for he was covered with ashes from head to foot  alice was very anxious to be of use and as the poor little lily was nearly screaming herself into a fit she hastily picked up the queen and set her on the table by the side of her noisy little daughter  the queen gasped and sat down  the rapid journey through the air had quite taken away her breath and for a minute or two she could do nothing but hug the little lily in silence as soon as she had recovered her breath a little she called out to the white king who was sitting sulkily among the ashes mind the volcano  what volcano said the king looking up anxiously into the fire as if he thought that was the most likely place to find one  blew me up panted the queen who was still a little out of breath mind you come up the regular way dont get blown up  alice watched the white king as he slowly struggled up from bar to bar till at last she said why youll be hours and hours getting to the table at that rate id far better help you hadnt i but the king took no notice of the question  it was quite clear that he could neither hear her nor see her  so alice picked him up very gently and lifted him across more slowly than she had lifted the queen that she mightnt take his breath away  but before she put him on the table she thought she might as well dust him a little he was so covered with ashes  she said afterwards that she had never seen in all her life such a face as the king made when he found himself held in the air by an invisible hand and being dusted  he was far too much astonished to cry out but his eyes and his mouth went on getting larger and larger and rounder and rounder till her hand shook so with laughing that she nearly let him drop upon the floor  oh please dont make such faces my dear she cried out quite forgetting that the king couldnt hear her you make me laugh so that i can hardly hold you and dont keep your mouth so wide open all the ashes will get into it there now i think youre tidy enough she added as she smoothed his hair and set him upon the table near the queen  the king immediately fell flat on his back and lay perfectly still  and alice was a little alarmed at what she had done and went round the room to see if she could find any water to throw over him however she could find nothing but a bottle of ink and when she got back with it she found he had recovered and he and the queen were talking together in a frightened whisper so low that alice could hardly hear what they said  the king was saying i assure you my dear i turned cold to the very ends of my whiskers  to which the queen replied you havent got any whiskers  the horror of that moment the king went on i shall never never forget  you will though the queen said if you dont make a memorandum of it  alice looked on with great interest as the king took an enormous memorandum book out of his pocket and began writing a sudden thought struck her and she took hold of the end of the pencil which came some way over his shoulder and began writing for him  the poor king looked puzzled and unhappy and struggled with the pencil for some time without saying anything but alice was too strong for him and at last he panted out my dear i really must get a thinner pencil i cant manage this one a bit it writes all manner of things that i dont intend   what manner of things said the queen looking over the book in which alice had put the white knight is sliding down the poker he balances very badly thats not a memorandum of your feelings  there was a book lying near alice on the table and while she sat watching the white king for she was still a little anxious about him and had the ink all ready to throw over him in case he fainted again she turned over the leaves to find some part that she could read  for its all in some language i dont know she said to herself  it was like this  ykcowrebbaj  sevot yhtils eht dna gillirb sawt ebaw eht ni elbmig dna eryg did      sevogorob eht erew ysmim lla ebargtuo shtar emom eht dna    she puzzled over this for some time but at last a bright thought struck her why its a looking glass book of course and if i hold it up to a glass the words will all go the right way again  this was the poem that alice read  jabberwocky  twas brillig and the slithy toves     did gyre and gimble in the wabe all mimsy were the borogoves     and the mome raths outgrabe  beware the jabberwock my son     the jaws that bite the claws that catch beware the jubjub bird and shun     the frumious bandersnatch  he took his vorpal sword in hand      long time the manxome foe he sought  so rested he by the tumtum tree     and stood awhile in thought  and as in uffish thought he stood     the jabberwock with eyes of flame came whiffling through the tulgey wood     and burbled as it came  one two one two and through and through     the vorpal blade went snicker snack he left it dead and with its head     he went galumphing back  and hast thou slain the jabberwock     come to my arms my beamish boy o frabjous day callooh callay     he chortled in his joy  twas brillig and the slithy toves     did gyre and gimble in the wabe all mimsy were the borogoves     and the mome raths outgrabe   it seems very pretty she said when she had finished it but its rather hard to understand you see she didnt like to confess even to herself that she couldnt make it out at all somehow it seems to fill my head with ideas only i dont exactly know what they are however somebody killed something  thats clear at any rate   but oh thought alice suddenly jumping up if i dont make haste i shall have to go back through the looking glass before ive seen what the rest of the house is like lets have a look at the garden first she was out of the room in a moment and ran down stairs or at least it wasnt exactly running but a new invention of hers for getting down stairs quickly and easily as alice said to herself she just kept the tips of her fingers on the hand rail and floated gently down without even touching the stairs with her feet then she floated on through the hall and would have gone straight out at the door in the same way if she hadnt caught hold of the door post she was getting a little giddy with so much floating in the air and was rather glad to find herself walking again in the natural way     chapter ii the garden of live flowers   i should see the garden far better said alice to herself if i could get to the top of that hill  and heres a path that leads straight to it at least no it doesnt do that  after going a few yards along the path and turning several sharp corners but i suppose it will at last but how curiously it twists its more like a corkscrew than a path well this turn goes to the hill i suppose no it doesnt this goes straight back to the house well then ill try it the other way  and so she did  wandering up and down and trying turn after turn but always coming back to the house do what she would indeed once when she turned a corner rather more quickly than usual she ran against it before she could stop herself  its no use talking about it alice said looking up at the house and pretending it was arguing with her im not going in again yet i know i should have to get through the looking glass again back into the old room and thered be an end of all my adventures  so resolutely turning her back upon the house she set out once more down the path determined to keep straight on till she got to the hill for a few minutes all went on well and she was just saying i really shall do it this time  when the path gave a sudden twist and shook itself as she described it afterwards and the next moment she found herself actually walking in at the door  oh its too bad she cried i never saw such a house for getting in the way never  however there was the hill full in sight so there was nothing to be done but start again this time she came upon a large flower bed with a border of daisies and a willow tree growing in the middle  o tiger lily said alice addressing herself to one that was waving gracefully about in the wind i wish you could talk  we can talk said the tiger lily  when theres anybody worth talking to  alice was so astonished that she could not speak for a minute  it quite seemed to take her breath away at length as the tiger lily only went on waving about she spoke again in a timid voice almost in a whisper and can all the flowers talk  as well as you can said the tiger lily and a great deal louder  it isnt manners for us to begin you know said the rose and i really was wondering when youd speak said i to myself â€˜her face has got some sense in it though its not a clever one still youre the right colour and that goes a long way  i dont care about the colour the tiger lily remarked if only her petals curled up a little more shed be all right  alice didnt like being criticised so she began asking questions arent you sometimes frightened at being planted out here with nobody to take care of you  theres the tree in the middle said the rose  what else is it good for  but what could it do if any danger came alice asked  it says â€˜bough wough cried a daisy  thats why its branches are called boughs  didnt you know that cried another daisy and here they all began shouting together till the air seemed quite full of little shrill voices silence every one of you cried the tiger lily waving itself passionately from side to side and trembling with excitement they know i cant get at them it panted bending its quivering head towards alice or they wouldnt dare to do it  never mind alice said in a soothing tone and stooping down to the daisies who were just beginning again she whispered if you dont hold your tongues ill pick you  there was silence in a moment and several of the pink daisies turned white  thats right said the tiger lily the daisies are worst of all when one speaks they all begin together and its enough to make one wither to hear the way they go on  how is it you can all talk so nicely alice said hoping to get it into a better temper by a compliment ive been in many gardens before but none of the flowers could talk  put your hand down and feel the ground said the tiger lily then youll know why  alice did so its very hard she said but i dont see what that has to do with it  in most gardens the tiger lily said they make the beds too soft so that the flowers are always asleep  this sounded a very good reason and alice was quite pleased to know it i never thought of that before she said  its my opinion that you never think at all the rose said in a rather severe tone  i never saw anybody that looked stupider a violet said so suddenly that alice quite jumped for it hadnt spoken before  hold your tongue cried the tiger lily as if you ever saw anybody you keep your head under the leaves and snore away there till you know no more whats going on in the world than if you were a bud  are there any more people in the garden besides me alice said not choosing to notice the roses last remark  theres one other flower in the garden that can move about like you said the rose i wonder how you do it  youre always wondering said the tiger lily but shes more bushy than you are  is she like me alice asked eagerly for the thought crossed her mind theres another little girl in the garden somewhere  well she has the same awkward shape as you the rose said but shes redder and her petals are shorter i think  her petals are done up close almost like a dahlia the tiger lily interrupted  not tumbled about anyhow like yours  but thats not your fault the rose added kindly  youre beginning to fade you know and then one cant help ones petals getting a little untidy  alice didnt like this idea at all  so to change the subject she asked does she ever come out here  i daresay youll see her soon said the rose shes one of the thorny kind  where does she wear the thorns alice asked with some curiosity  why all round her head of course the rose replied i was wondering you hadnt got some too i thought it was the regular rule  shes coming cried the larkspur i hear her footstep thump thump thump along the gravel walk  alice looked round eagerly and found that it was the red queen shes grown a good deal was her first remark she had indeed  when alice first found her in the ashes she had been only three inches high and here she was half a head taller than alice herself  its the fresh air that does it said the rose  wonderfully fine air it is out here  i think ill go and meet her said alice for though the flowers were interesting enough she felt that it would be far grander to have a talk with a real queen  you cant possibly do that said the rose  i should advise you to walk the other way  this sounded nonsense to alice so she said nothing but set off at once towards the red queen to her surprise she lost sight of her in a moment and found herself walking in at the front door again  a little provoked she drew back and after looking everywhere for the queen whom she spied out at last a long way off she thought she would try the plan this time of walking in the opposite direction  it succeeded beautifully she had not been walking a minute before she found herself face to face with the red queen and full in sight of the hill she had been so long aiming at  where do you come from said the red queen and where are you going look up speak nicely and dont twiddle your fingers all the time  alice attended to all these directions and explained as well as she could that she had lost her way  i dont know what you mean by your way said the queen  all the ways about here belong to me but why did you come out here at all she added in a kinder tone curtsey while youre thinking what to say it saves time  alice wondered a little at this but she was too much in awe of the queen to disbelieve it ill try it when i go home she thought to herself the next time im a little late for dinner  its time for you to answer now the queen said looking at her watch  open your mouth a little wider when you speak and always say â€˜your majesty  i only wanted to see what the garden was like your majesty   thats right said the queen patting her on the head which alice didnt like at all though when you say â€˜garden ive seen gardens compared with which this would be a wilderness  alice didnt dare to argue the point but went on   and i thought id try and find my way to the top of that hill   when you say â€˜hill the queen interrupted i could show you hills in comparison with which youd call that a valley  no i shouldnt said alice surprised into contradicting her at last  a hill cant be a valley you know that would be nonsense   the red queen shook her head you may call it â€˜nonsense if you like she said but ive heard nonsense compared with which that would be as sensible as a dictionary  alice curtseyed again as she was afraid from the queens tone that she was a little offended  and they walked on in silence till they got to the top of the little hill  for some minutes alice stood without speaking looking out in all directions over the country and a most curious country it was there were a number of tiny little brooks running straight across it from side to side and the ground between was divided up into squares by a number of little green hedges that reached from brook to brook  i declare its marked out just like a large chessboard alice said at last there ought to be some men moving about somewhere and so there are she added in a tone of delight and her heart began to beat quick with excitement as she went on its a great huge game of chess thats being played all over the world if this is the world at all you know oh what fun it is how i wish i was one of them i wouldnt mind being a pawn if only i might join though of course i should like to be a queen best  she glanced rather shyly at the real queen as she said this but her companion only smiled pleasantly and said thats easily managed you can be the white queens pawn if you like as lilys too young to play and youre in the second square to begin with  when you get to the eighth square youll be a queen  just at this moment somehow or other they began to run  alice never could quite make out in thinking it over afterwards how it was that they began  all she remembers is that they were running hand in hand and the queen went so fast that it was all she could do to keep up with her  and still the queen kept crying faster faster but alice felt she could not go faster though she had not breath left to say so  the most curious part of the thing was that the trees and the other things round them never changed their places at all  however fast they went they never seemed to pass anything i wonder if all the things move along with us thought poor puzzled alice and the queen seemed to guess her thoughts for she cried faster dont try to talk  not that alice had any idea of doing that she felt as if she would never be able to talk again she was getting so much out of breath  and still the queen cried faster faster and dragged her along are we nearly there alice managed to pant out at last  nearly there the queen repeated why we passed it ten minutes ago faster and they ran on for a time in silence with the wind whistling in alices ears and almost blowing her hair off her head she fancied  now now cried the queen faster faster and they went so fast that at last they seemed to skim through the air hardly touching the ground with their feet till suddenly just as alice was getting quite exhausted they stopped and she found herself sitting on the ground breathless and giddy  the queen propped her up against a tree and said kindly you may rest a little now  alice looked round her in great surprise why i do believe weve been under this tree the whole time everythings just as it was  of course it is said the queen what would you have it  well in our country said alice still panting a little youd generally get to somewhere else if you ran very fast for a long time as weve been doing  a slow sort of country said the queen now here you see it takes all the running you can do to keep in the same place if you want to get somewhere else you must run at least twice as fast as that  id rather not try please said alice im quite content to stay here only i am so hot and thirsty  i know what youd like the queen said good naturedly taking a little box out of her pocket have a biscuit  alice thought it would not be civil to say no though it wasnt at all what she wanted so she took it and ate it as well as she could  and it was very dry and she thought she had never been so nearly choked in all her life  while youre refreshing yourself said the queen ill just take the measurements and she took a ribbon out of her pocket marked in inches and began measuring the ground and sticking little pegs in here and there  at the end of two yards she said putting in a peg to mark the distance i shall give you your directions have another biscuit  no thank you said alice  ones quite enough  thirst quenched i hope said the queen  alice did not know what to say to this but luckily the queen did not wait for an answer but went on at the end of three yards i shall repeat them for fear of your forgetting them at the end of four i shall say good bye and at the end of five i shall go  she had got all the pegs put in by this time and alice looked on with great interest as she returned to the tree and then began slowly walking down the row  at the two yard peg she faced round and said a pawn goes two squares in its first move you know so youll go very quickly through the third square by railway i should think and youll find yourself in the fourth square in no time well that square belongs to tweedledum and tweedledee the fifth is mostly water the sixth belongs to humpty dumpty but you make no remark  i i didnt know i had to make one just then alice faltered out  you should have said â€˜its extremely kind of you to tell me all this however well suppose it said the seventh square is all forest however one of the knights will show you the way and in the eighth square we shall be queens together and its all feasting and fun alice got up and curtseyed and sat down again  at the next peg the queen turned again and this time she said speak in french when you cant think of the english for a thing turn out your toes as you walk and remember who you are she did not wait for alice to curtsey this time but walked on quickly to the next peg where she turned for a moment to say good bye and then hurried on to the last  how it happened alice never knew but exactly as she came to the last peg she was gone whether she vanished into the air or whether she ran quickly into the wood and she can run very fast thought alice there was no way of guessing but she was gone and alice began to remember that she was a pawn and that it would soon be time for her to move     chapter iii looking glass insects   of course the first thing to do was to make a grand survey of the country she was going to travel through its something very like learning geography thought alice as she stood on tiptoe in hopes of being able to see a little further principal rivers there are none principal mountains im on the only one but i dont think its got any name principal towns why what are those creatures making honey down there they cant be bees nobody ever saw bees a mile off you know  and for some time she stood silent watching one of them that was bustling about among the flowers poking its proboscis into them just as if it was a regular bee thought alice  however this was anything but a regular bee  in fact it was an elephant as alice soon found out though the idea quite took her breath away at first and what enormous flowers they must be was her next idea something like cottages with the roofs taken off and stalks put to them and what quantities of honey they must make i think ill go down and no i wont just yet she went on checking herself just as she was beginning to run down the hill and trying to find some excuse for turning shy so suddenly itll never do to go down among them without a good long branch to brush them away and what fun itll be when they ask me how i like my walk i shall say â€˜oh i like it well enough  here came the favourite little toss of the head â€˜only it was so dusty and hot and the elephants did tease so  i think ill go down the other way she said after a pause  and perhaps i may visit the elephants later on besides i do so want to get into the third square  so with this excuse she ran down the hill and jumped over the first of the six little brooks                                                                                                                   tickets please said the guard putting his head in at the window in a moment everybody was holding out a ticket  they were about the same size as the people and quite seemed to fill the carriage  now then show your ticket child the guard went on looking angrily at alice and a great many voices all said together like the chorus of a song thought alice dont keep him waiting child why his time is worth a thousand pounds a minute  im afraid i havent got one alice said in a frightened tone  there wasnt a ticket office where i came from and again the chorus of voices went on there wasnt room for one where she came from the land there is worth a thousand pounds an inch  dont make excuses said the guard  you should have bought one from the engine driver and once more the chorus of voices went on with the man that drives the engine why the smoke alone is worth a thousand pounds a puff  alice thought to herself then theres no use in speaking the voices didnt join in this time as she hadnt spoken but to her great surprise they all thought in chorus i hope you understand what thinking in chorus means for i must confess that i dont better say nothing at all language is worth a thousand pounds a word  i shall dream about a thousand pounds tonight i know i shall thought alice  all this time the guard was looking at her first through a telescope then through a microscope and then through an opera glass at last he said youre travelling the wrong way and shut up the window and went away  so young a child said the gentleman sitting opposite to her he was dressed in white paper ought to know which way shes going even if she doesnt know her own name  a goat that was sitting next to the gentleman in white shut his eyes and said in a loud voice she ought to know her way to the ticket office even if she doesnt know her alphabet  there was a beetle sitting next to the goat it was a very queer carriage full of passengers altogether and as the rule seemed to be that they should all speak in turn he went on with shell have to go back from here as luggage  alice couldnt see who was sitting beyond the beetle but a hoarse voice spoke next change engines  it said and was obliged to leave off  it sounds like a horse alice thought to herself and an extremely small voice close to her ear said you might make a joke on that something about â€˜horse and â€˜hoarse you know  then a very gentle voice in the distance said she must be labelled â€˜lass with care you know   and after that other voices went on what a number of people there are in the carriage thought alice saying she must go by post as shes got a head on her  she must be sent as a message by the telegraph  she must draw the train herself the rest of the way  and so on  but the gentleman dressed in white paper leaned forwards and whispered in her ear never mind what they all say my dear but take a return ticket every time the train stops  indeed i shant alice said rather impatiently i dont belong to this railway journey at all i was in a wood just now and i wish i could get back there  you might make a joke on that said the little voice close to her ear  something about â€˜you would if you could you know  dont tease so said alice looking about in vain to see where the voice came from if youre so anxious to have a joke made why dont you make one yourself  the little voice sighed deeply  it was very unhappy evidently and alice would have said something pitying to comfort it if it would only sigh like other people she thought but this was such a wonderfully small sigh that she wouldnt have heard it at all if it hadnt come quite close to her ear the consequence of this was that it tickled her ear very much and quite took off her thoughts from the unhappiness of the poor little creature  i know you are a friend the little voice went on a dear friend and an old friend and you wont hurt me though i am an insect  what kind of insect alice inquired a little anxiously what she really wanted to know was whether it could sting or not but she thought this wouldnt be quite a civil question to ask  what then you dont  the little voice began when it was drowned by a shrill scream from the engine and everybody jumped up in alarm alice among the rest  the horse who had put his head out of the window quietly drew it in and said its only a brook we have to jump over everybody seemed satisfied with this though alice felt a little nervous at the idea of trains jumping at all however itll take us into the fourth square thats some comfort she said to herself in another moment she felt the carriage rise straight up into the air and in her fright she caught at the thing nearest to her hand which happened to be the goats beard                                                                                                                   but the beard seemed to melt away as she touched it and she found herself sitting quietly under a tree while the gnat for that was the insect she had been talking to was balancing itself on a twig just over her head and fanning her with its wings  it certainly was a very large gnat  about the size of a chicken alice thought still she couldnt feel nervous with it after they had been talking together so long   then you dont like all insects the gnat went on as quietly as if nothing had happened  i like them when they can talk alice said none of them ever talk where i come from  what sort of insects do you rejoice in where you come from the gnat inquired  i dont rejoice in insects at all alice explained because im rather afraid of them at least the large kinds but i can tell you the names of some of them  of course they answer to their names the gnat remarked carelessly  i never knew them to do it  whats the use of their having names the gnat said if they wont answer to them  no use to them said alice but its useful to the people who name them i suppose if not why do things have names at all  i cant say the gnat replied further on in the wood down there theyve got no names however go on with your list of insects  youre wasting time  well theres the horse fly alice began counting off the names on her fingers  all right said the gnat  half way up that bush youll see a rocking horse fly if you look its made entirely of wood and gets about by swinging itself from branch to branch  what does it live on alice asked with great curiosity  sap and sawdust said the gnat go on with the list  alice looked up at the rocking horse fly with great interest and made up her mind that it must have been just repainted it looked so bright and sticky and then she went on  and theres the dragon fly  look on the branch above your head said the gnat and there youll find a snap dragon fly its body is made of plum pudding its wings of holly leaves and its head is a raisin burning in brandy  and what does it live on  frumenty and mince pie the gnat replied and it makes its nest in a christmas box  and then theres the butterfly alice went on after she had taken a good look at the insect with its head on fire and had thought to herself i wonder if thats the reason insects are so fond of flying into candles because they want to turn into snap dragon flies  crawling at your feet said the gnat alice drew her feet back in some alarm you may observe a bread and butterfly its wings are thin slices of bread and butter its body is a crust and its head is a lump of sugar  and what does it live on  weak tea with cream in it  a new difficulty came into alices head supposing it couldnt find any she suggested  then it would die of course  but that must happen very often alice remarked thoughtfully  it always happens said the gnat  after this alice was silent for a minute or two pondering the gnat amused itself meanwhile by humming round and round her head  at last it settled again and remarked i suppose you dont want to lose your name  no indeed alice said a little anxiously  and yet i dont know the gnat went on in a careless tone  only think how convenient it would be if you could manage to go home without it for instance if the governess wanted to call you to your lessons she would call out â€˜come here  and there she would have to leave off because there wouldnt be any name for her to call and of course you wouldnt have to go you know  that would never do im sure said alice  the governess would never think of excusing me lessons for that if she couldnt remember my name shed call me â€˜miss as the servants do  well if she said â€˜miss and didnt say anything more the gnat remarked of course youd miss your lessons thats a joke i wish you had made it  why do you wish i had made it alice asked its a very bad one  but the gnat only sighed deeply while two large tears came rolling down its cheeks  you shouldnt make jokes alice said if it makes you so unhappy  then came another of those melancholy little sighs and this time the poor gnat really seemed to have sighed itself away for when alice looked up there was nothing whatever to be seen on the twig and as she was getting quite chilly with sitting still so long she got up and walked on  she very soon came to an open field with a wood on the other side of it  it looked much darker than the last wood and alice felt a little timid about going into it however on second thoughts she made up her mind to go on  for i certainly wont go back she thought to herself and this was the only way to the eighth square  this must be the wood she said thoughtfully to herself where things have no names i wonder whatll become of my name when i go in i shouldnt like to lose it at all because theyd have to give me another and it would be almost certain to be an ugly one but then the fun would be trying to find the creature that had got my old name thats just like the advertisements you know when people lose dogs â€˜answers to the name of dash  had on a brass collar just fancy calling everything you met â€˜alice till one of them answered only they wouldnt answer at all if they were wise  she was rambling on in this way when she reached the wood  it looked very cool and shady well at any rate its a great comfort she said as she stepped under the trees after being so hot to get into the into what she went on rather surprised at not being able to think of the word i mean to get under the under the under this you know putting her hand on the trunk of the tree what does it call itself i wonder i do believe its got no name why to be sure it hasnt  she stood silent for a minute thinking  then she suddenly began again then it really has happened after all and now who am i i will remember if i can im determined to do it but being determined didnt help much and all she could say after a great deal of puzzling was l i know it begins with l  just then a fawn came wandering by  it looked at alice with its large gentle eyes but didnt seem at all frightened here then here then alice said as she held out her hand and tried to stroke it but it only started back a little and then stood looking at her again  what do you call yourself the fawn said at last such a soft sweet voice it had  i wish i knew thought poor alice she answered rather sadly nothing just now  think again it said  that wont do  alice thought but nothing came of it please would you tell me what you call yourself she said timidly i think that might help a little  ill tell you if youll move a little further on the fawn said i cant remember here  so they walked on together though the wood alice with her arms clasped lovingly round the soft neck of the fawn till they came out into another open field and here the fawn gave a sudden bound into the air and shook itself free from alices arms im a fawn it cried out in a voice of delight and dear me youre a human child a sudden look of alarm came into its beautiful brown eyes and in another moment it had darted away at full speed  alice stood looking after it almost ready to cry with vexation at having lost her dear little fellow traveller so suddenly however i know my name now she said thats some comfort alice alice i wont forget it again and now which of these finger posts ought i to follow i wonder  it was not a very difficult question to answer as there was only one road through the wood and the two finger posts both pointed along it ill settle it alice said to herself when the road divides and they point different ways  but this did not seem likely to happen she went on and on a long way but wherever the road divided there were sure to be two finger posts pointing the same way one marked to tweedledums house and the other to the house of tweedledee  i do believe said alice at last that they live in the same house i wonder i never thought of that before but i cant stay there long ill just call and say â€˜how dyou do and ask them the way out of the wood if i could only get to the eighth square before it gets dark so she wandered on talking to herself as she went till on turning a sharp corner she came upon two fat little men so suddenly that she could not help starting back but in another moment she recovered herself feeling sure that they must be     chapter iv tweedledum and tweedledee   they were standing under a tree each with an arm round the others neck and alice knew which was which in a moment because one of them had dum embroidered on his collar and the other dee i suppose theyve each got â€˜tweedle round at the back of the collar she said to herself  they stood so still that she quite forgot they were alive and she was just looking round to see if the word â€˜tweedle was written at the back of each collar when she was startled by a voice coming from the one marked dum  if you think were wax works he said you ought to pay you know wax works werent made to be looked at for nothing nohow  contrariwise added the one marked dee if you think were alive you ought to speak  im sure im very sorry was all alice could say for the words of the old song kept ringing through her head like the ticking of a clock and she could hardly help saying them out loud    tweedledum and tweedledee     agreed to have a battle for tweedledum said tweedledee     had spoiled his nice new rattle  just then flew down a monstrous crow     as black as a tar barrel which frightened both the heroes so     they quite forgot their quarrel   i know what youre thinking about said tweedledum  but it isnt so nohow  contrariwise continued tweedledee if it was so it might be and if it were so it would be but as it isnt it aint thats logic  i was thinking alice said very politely which is the best way out of this wood  its getting so dark would you tell me please  but the little men only looked at each other and grinned  they looked so exactly like a couple of great schoolboys that alice couldnt help pointing her finger at tweedledum and saying first boy  nohow tweedledum cried out briskly and shut his mouth up again with a snap  next boy said alice passing on to tweedledee though she felt quite certain he would only shout out contrariwise and so he did  youve been wrong cried tweedledum the first thing in a visit is to say â€˜how dye do and shake hands and here the two brothers gave each other a hug and then they held out the two hands that were free to shake hands with her  alice did not like shaking hands with either of them first for fear of hurting the other ones feelings so as the best way out of the difficulty she took hold of both hands at once  the next moment they were dancing round in a ring this seemed quite natural she remembered afterwards and she was not even surprised to hear music playing  it seemed to come from the tree under which they were dancing and it was done as well as she could make it out by the branches rubbing one across the other like fiddles and fiddle sticks  but it certainly was funny alice said afterwards when she was telling her sister the history of all this to find myself singing â€˜here we go round the mulberry bush i dont know when i began it but somehow i felt as if id been singing it a long long time  the other two dancers were fat and very soon out of breath four times round is enough for one dance tweedledum panted out and they left off dancing as suddenly as they had begun  the music stopped at the same moment  then they let go of alices hands and stood looking at her for a minute  there was a rather awkward pause as alice didnt know how to begin a conversation with people she had just been dancing with it would never do to say â€˜how dye do now she said to herself  we seem to have got beyond that somehow  i hope youre not much tired she said at last  nohow and thank you very much for asking said tweedledum  so much obliged added tweedledee you like poetry  ye es pretty well some poetry alice said doubtfully would you tell me which road leads out of the wood  what shall i repeat to her said tweedledee looking round at tweedledum with great solemn eyes and not noticing alices question  â€˜the walrus and the carpenter is the longest tweedledum replied giving his brother an affectionate hug  tweedledee began instantly   the sun was shining    here alice ventured to interrupt him if its very long she said as politely as she could would you please tell me first which road   tweedledee smiled gently and began again   the sun was shining on the sea     shining with all his might  he did his very best to make     the billows smooth and bright  and this was odd because it was     the middle of the night  the moon was shining sulkily     because she thought the sun had got no business to be there     after the day was done  â€˜its very rude of him she said     â€˜to come and spoil the fun  the sea was wet as wet could be     the sands were dry as dry you could not see a cloud because     no cloud was in the sky  no birds were flying over head      there were no birds to fly  the walrus and the carpenter     were walking close at hand they wept like anything to see     such quantities of sand  â€˜if this were only cleared away     they said â€˜it would be grand  â€˜if seven maids with seven mops     swept it for half a year do you suppose the walrus said     â€˜that they could get it clear â€˜i doubt it said the carpenter     and shed a bitter tear  â€˜o oysters come and walk with us     the walrus did beseech â€˜a pleasant walk a pleasant talk     along the briny beach  we cannot do with more than four     to give a hand to each  the eldest oyster looked at him     but never a word he said  the eldest oyster winked his eye     and shook his heavy head  meaning to say he did not choose     to leave the oyster bed  but four young oysters hurried up     all eager for the treat  their coats were brushed their faces washed     their shoes were clean and neat  and this was odd because you know     they hadnt any feet  four other oysters followed them     and yet another four and thick and fast they came at last     and more and more and more  all hopping through the frothy waves     and scrambling to the shore  the walrus and the carpenter     walked on a mile or so and then they rested on a rock     conveniently low  and all the little oysters stood     and waited in a row  â€˜the time has come the walrus said     â€˜to talk of many things  of shoes and ships and sealing wax      of cabbages and kings  and why the sea is boiling hot      and whether pigs have wings  â€˜but wait a bit the oysters cried     â€˜before we have our chat for some of us are out of breath     and all of us are fat â€˜no hurry said the carpenter     they thanked him much for that  â€˜a loaf of bread the walrus said     â€˜is what we chiefly need  pepper and vinegar besides     are very good indeed  now if youre ready oysters dear     we can begin to feed  â€˜but not on us the oysters cried     turning a little blue â€˜after such kindness that would be     a dismal thing to do â€˜the night is fine the walrus said     â€˜do you admire the view  â€˜it was so kind of you to come     and you are very nice the carpenter said nothing but     â€˜cut us another slice  i wish you were not quite so deaf      ive had to ask you twice  â€˜it seems a shame the walrus said     â€˜to play them such a trick after weve brought them out so far     and made them trot so quick the carpenter said nothing but     â€˜the butters spread too thick  â€˜i weep for you the walrus said     â€˜i deeply sympathize with sobs and tears he sorted out     those of the largest size holding his pocket handkerchief     before his streaming eyes  â€˜o oysters said the carpenter     â€˜youve had a pleasant run shall we be trotting home again     but answer came there none  and that was scarcely odd because     theyd eaten every one   i like the walrus best said alice  because you see he was a little sorry for the poor oysters  he ate more than the carpenter though said tweedledee you see he held his handkerchief in front so that the carpenter couldnt count how many he took  contrariwise  that was mean alice said indignantly then i like the carpenter best if he didnt eat so many as the walrus  but he ate as many as he could get said tweedledum  this was a puzzler after a pause alice began well they were both very unpleasant characters  here she checked herself in some alarm at hearing something that sounded to her like the puffing of a large steam engine in the wood near them though she feared it was more likely to be a wild beast are there any lions or tigers about here she asked timidly  its only the red king snoring said tweedledee  come and look at him the brothers cried and they each took one of alices hands and led her up to where the king was sleeping  isnt he a lovely sight said tweedledum  alice couldnt say honestly that he was he had a tall red night cap on with a tassel and he was lying crumpled up into a sort of untidy heap and snoring loud fit to snore his head off as tweedledum remarked  im afraid hell catch cold with lying on the damp grass said alice who was a very thoughtful little girl  hes dreaming now said tweedledee  and what do you think hes dreaming about  alice said nobody can guess that  why about you tweedledee exclaimed clapping his hands triumphantly and if he left off dreaming about you where do you suppose youd be  where i am now of course said alice  not you tweedledee retorted contemptuously youd be nowhere why youre only a sort of thing in his dream  if that there king was to wake added tweedledum youd go out bang just like a candle  i shouldnt alice exclaimed indignantly besides if im only a sort of thing in his dream what are you i should like to know  ditto said tweedledum  ditto ditto cried tweedledee  he shouted this so loud that alice couldnt help saying hush youll be waking him im afraid if you make so much noise  well it no use your talking about waking him said tweedledum when youre only one of the things in his dream you know very well youre not real  i am real said alice and began to cry  you wont make yourself a bit realler by crying tweedledee remarked  theres nothing to cry about  if i wasnt real alice said half laughing through her tears it all seemed so ridiculous i shouldnt be able to cry  i hope you dont suppose those are real tears tweedledum interrupted in a tone of great contempt  i know theyre talking nonsense alice thought to herself  and its foolish to cry about it so she brushed away her tears and went on as cheerfully as she could at any rate id better be getting out of the wood for really its coming on very dark do you think its going to rain  tweedledum spread a large umbrella over himself and his brother and looked up into it no i dont think it is he said  at least not under here nohow  but it may rain outside  it may if it chooses said tweedledee  weve no objection contrariwise  selfish things thought alice and she was just going to say good night and leave them when tweedledum sprang out from under the umbrella and seized her by the wrist  do you see that he said in a voice choking with passion and his eyes grew large and yellow all in a moment as he pointed with a trembling finger at a small white thing lying under the tree  its only a rattle alice said after a careful examination of the little white thing not a rattle snake you know she added hastily thinking that he was frightened  only an old rattle quite old and broken  i knew it was cried tweedledum beginning to stamp about wildly and tear his hair its spoilt of course here he looked at tweedledee who immediately sat down on the ground and tried to hide himself under the umbrella  alice laid her hand upon his arm and said in a soothing tone you neednt be so angry about an old rattle  but it isnt old tweedledum cried in a greater fury than ever its new i tell you i bought it yesterday my nice new rattle and his voice rose to a perfect scream  all this time tweedledee was trying his best to fold up the umbrella with himself in it  which was such an extraordinary thing to do that it quite took off alices attention from the angry brother but he couldnt quite succeed and it ended in his rolling over bundled up in the umbrella with only his head out  and there he lay opening and shutting his mouth and his large eyes looking more like a fish than anything else alice thought  of course you agree to have a battle tweedledum said in a calmer tone  i suppose so the other sulkily replied as he crawled out of the umbrella  only she must help us to dress up you know  so the two brothers went off hand in hand into the wood and returned in a minute with their arms full of things such as bolsters blankets hearth rugs table cloths dish covers and coal scuttles i hope youre a good hand at pinning and tying strings tweedledum remarked every one of these things has got to go on somehow or other  alice said afterwards she had never seen such a fuss made about anything in all her life the way those two bustled about and the quantity of things they put on and the trouble they gave her in tying strings and fastening buttons really theyll be more like bundles of old clothes than anything else by the time theyre ready she said to herself as she arranged a bolster round the neck of tweedledee to keep his head from being cut off as he said  you know he added very gravely its one of the most serious things that can possibly happen to one in a battle to get ones head cut off  alice laughed aloud  but she managed to turn it into a cough for fear of hurting his feelings  do i look very pale said tweedledum coming up to have his helmet tied on he called it a helmet though it certainly looked much more like a saucepan  well yes a little alice replied gently  im very brave generally he went on in a low voice  only to day i happen to have a headache  and ive got a toothache said tweedledee who had overheard the remark im far worse off than you  then youd better not fight to day said alice thinking it a good opportunity to make peace  we must have a bit of a fight but i dont care about going on long said tweedledum whats the time now  tweedledee looked at his watch and said half past four  lets fight till six and then have dinner said tweedledum  very well the other said rather sadly  and she can watch us only youd better not come very close he added  i generally hit everything i can see when i get really excited  and i hit everything within reach cried tweedledum whether i can see it or not  alice laughed you must hit the trees pretty often i should think she said  tweedledum looked round him with a satisfied smile i dont suppose he said therell be a tree left standing for ever so far round by the time weve finished  and all about a rattle said alice still hoping to make them a little ashamed of fighting for such a trifle  i shouldnt have minded it so much said tweedledum if it hadnt been a new one  i wish the monstrous crow would come thought alice  theres only one sword you know tweedledum said to his brother  but you can have the umbrella its quite as sharp only we must begin quick its getting as dark as it can  and darker said tweedledee  it was getting dark so suddenly that alice thought there must be a thunderstorm coming on what a thick black cloud that is she said and how fast it comes why i do believe its got wings  its the crow tweedledum cried out in a shrill voice of alarm  and the two brothers took to their heels and were out of sight in a moment  alice ran a little way into the wood and stopped under a large tree it can never get at me here she thought  its far too large to squeeze itself in among the trees but i wish it wouldnt flap its wings so it makes quite a hurricane in the wood heres somebodys shawl being blown away     chapter v wool and water   she caught the shawl as she spoke and looked about for the owner  in another moment the white queen came running wildly through the wood with both arms stretched out wide as if she were flying and alice very civilly went to meet her with the shawl  im very glad i happened to be in the way alice said as she helped her to put on her shawl again  the white queen only looked at her in a helpless frightened sort of way and kept repeating something in a whisper to herself that sounded like bread and butter bread and butter and alice felt that if there was to be any conversation at all she must manage it herself so she began rather timidly  am i addressing the white queen  well yes if you call that a dressing the queen said it isnt my notion of the thing at all  alice thought it would never do to have an argument at the very beginning of their conversation so she smiled and said if your majesty will only tell me the right way to begin ill do it as well as i can  but i dont want it done at all groaned the poor queen ive been a dressing myself for the last two hours  it would have been all the better as it seemed to alice if she had got some one else to dress her she was so dreadfully untidy every single things crooked alice thought to herself and shes all over pins may i put your shawl straight for you she added aloud  i dont know whats the matter with it the queen said in a melancholy voice its out of temper i think ive pinned it here and ive pinned it there but theres no pleasing it  it cant go straight you know if you pin it all on one side alice said as she gently put it right for her and dear me what a state your hair is in  the brush has got entangled in it the queen said with a sigh and i lost the comb yesterday  alice carefully released the brush and did her best to get the hair into order come you look rather better now she said after altering most of the pins but really you should have a ladys maid  im sure ill take you with pleasure the queen said twopence a week and jam every other day  alice couldnt help laughing as she said i dont want you to hire me and i dont care for jam  its very good jam said the queen  well i dont want any to day at any rate  you couldnt have it if you did want it the queen said the rule is jam to morrow and jam yesterday but never jam to day  it must come sometimes to â€˜jam to day alice objected  no it cant said the queen its jam every other day  to day isnt any other day you know  i dont understand you said alice its dreadfully confusing  thats the effect of living backwards the queen said kindly  it always makes one a little giddy at first   living backwards alice repeated in great astonishment i never heard of such a thing   but theres one great advantage in it that ones memory works both ways  im sure mine only works one way alice remarked i cant remember things before they happen  its a poor sort of memory that only works backwards the queen remarked  what sort of things do you remember best alice ventured to ask  oh things that happened the week after next the queen replied in a careless tone for instance now she went on sticking a large piece of plaster on her finger as she spoke theres the kings messenger hes in prison now being punished  and the trial doesnt even begin till next wednesday  and of course the crime comes last of all  suppose he never commits the crime said alice  that would be all the better wouldnt it the queen said as she bound the plaster round her finger with a bit of ribbon  alice felt there was no denying that of course it would be all the better she said  but it wouldnt be all the better his being punished  youre wrong there at any rate said the queen  were you ever punished  only for faults said alice  and you were all the better for it i know the queen said triumphantly  yes but then i had done the things i was punished for said alice  that makes all the difference  but if you hadnt done them the queen said that would have been better still better and better and better her voice went higher with each better till it got quite to a squeak at last  alice was just beginning to say theres a mistake somewhere  when the queen began screaming so loud that she had to leave the sentence unfinished oh oh oh shouted the queen shaking her hand about as if she wanted to shake it off my fingers bleeding oh oh oh oh  her screams were so exactly like the whistle of a steam engine that alice had to hold both her hands over her ears  what is the matter she said as soon as there was a chance of making herself heard have you pricked your finger  i havent pricked it yet the queen said but i soon shall oh oh oh  when do you expect to do it alice asked feeling very much inclined to laugh  when i fasten my shawl again the poor queen groaned out  the brooch will come undone directly oh oh as she said the words the brooch flew open and the queen clutched wildly at it and tried to clasp it again  take care cried alice youre holding it all crooked and she caught at the brooch but it was too late  the pin had slipped and the queen had pricked her finger  that accounts for the bleeding you see she said to alice with a smile now you understand the way things happen here  but why dont you scream now alice asked holding her hands ready to put over her ears again  why ive done all the screaming already said the queen what would be the good of having it all over again  by this time it was getting light the crow must have flown away i think said alice  im so glad its gone i thought it was the night coming on  i wish i could manage to be glad the queen said only i never can remember the rule you must be very happy living in this wood and being glad whenever you like  only it is so very lonely here alice said in a melancholy voice and at the thought of her loneliness two large tears came rolling down her cheeks  oh dont go on like that cried the poor queen wringing her hands in despair consider what a great girl you are consider what a long way youve come to day consider what oclock it is consider anything only dont cry  alice could not help laughing at this even in the midst of her tears can you keep from crying by considering things she asked  thats the way its done the queen said with great decision  nobody can do two things at once you know lets consider your age to begin with how old are you  im seven and a half exactly  you neednt say â€˜exactually the queen remarked  i can believe it without that now ill give you something to believe im just one hundred and one five months and a day  i cant believe that said alice  cant you the queen said in a pitying tone try again  draw a long breath and shut your eyes  alice laughed theres no use trying she said  one cant believe impossible things  i daresay you havent had much practice said the queen when i was your age i always did it for half an hour a day why sometimes ive believed as many as six impossible things before breakfast there goes the shawl again  the brooch had come undone as she spoke and a sudden gust of wind blew the queens shawl across a little brook the queen spread out her arms again and went flying after it and this time she succeeded in catching it for herself ive got it she cried in a triumphant tone now you shall see me pin it on again all by myself  then i hope your finger is better now alice said very politely as she crossed the little brook after the queen                                                                                                                   oh much better cried the queen her voice rising to a squeak as she went on much be etter be etter be e e etter be e ehh the last word ended in a long bleat so like a sheep that alice quite started  she looked at the queen who seemed to have suddenly wrapped herself up in wool alice rubbed her eyes and looked again she couldnt make out what had happened at all was she in a shop and was that really was it really a sheep that was sitting on the other side of the counter rub as she could she could make nothing more of it  she was in a little dark shop leaning with her elbows on the counter and opposite to her was an old sheep sitting in an arm chair knitting and every now and then leaving off to look at her through a great pair of spectacles  what is it you want to buy the sheep said at last looking up for a moment from her knitting  i dont quite know yet alice said very gently i should like to look all round me first if i might  you may look in front of you and on both sides if you like said the sheep  but you cant look all round you unless youve got eyes at the back of your head  but these as it happened alice had not got  so she contented herself with turning round looking at the shelves as she came to them  the shop seemed to be full of all manner of curious things but the oddest part of it all was that whenever she looked hard at any shelf to make out exactly what it had on it that particular shelf was always quite empty  though the others round it were crowded as full as they could hold  things flow about so here she said at last in a plaintive tone after she had spent a minute or so in vainly pursuing a large bright thing that looked sometimes like a doll and sometimes like a work box and was always in the shelf next above the one she was looking at and this one is the most provoking of all but ill tell you what  she added as a sudden thought struck her ill follow it up to the very top shelf of all itll puzzle it to go through the ceiling i expect  but even this plan failed  the thing went through the ceiling as quietly as possible as if it were quite used to it  are you a child or a teetotum the sheep said as she took up another pair of needles youll make me giddy soon if you go on turning round like that she was now working with fourteen pairs at once and alice couldnt help looking at her in great astonishment  how can she knit with so many the puzzled child thought to herself she gets more and more like a porcupine every minute  can you row the sheep asked handing her a pair of knitting needles as she spoke  yes a little but not on land and not with needles  alice was beginning to say when suddenly the needles turned into oars in her hands and she found they were in a little boat gliding along between banks  so there was nothing for it but to do her best  feather cried the sheep as she took up another pair of needles  this didnt sound like a remark that needed any answer so alice said nothing but pulled away there was something very queer about the water she thought as every now and then the oars got fast in it and would hardly come out again  feather feather the sheep cried again taking more needles youll be catching a crab directly  a dear little crab thought alice i should like that  didnt you hear me say â€˜feather the sheep cried angrily taking up quite a bunch of needles  indeed i did said alice  youve said it very often and very loud please where are the crabs  in the water of course said the sheep sticking some of the needles into her hair as her hands were full feather i say  why do you say â€˜feather so often alice asked at last rather vexed im not a bird  you are said the sheep  youre a little goose  this offended alice a little so there was no more conversation for a minute or two while the boat glided gently on sometimes among beds of weeds which made the oars stick fast in the water worse then ever and sometimes under trees but always with the same tall river banks frowning over their heads  oh please there are some scented rushes alice cried in a sudden transport of delight there really are and such beauties  you neednt say â€˜please to me about em the sheep said without looking up from her knitting  i didnt put em there and im not going to take em away  no but i meant please may we wait and pick some alice pleaded if you dont mind stopping the boat for a minute  how am i to stop it said the sheep if you leave off rowing itll stop of itself  so the boat was left to drift down the stream as it would till it glided gently in among the waving rushes and then the little sleeves were carefully rolled up and the little arms were plunged in elbow deep to get the rushes a good long way down before breaking them off and for a while alice forgot all about the sheep and the knitting as she bent over the side of the boat with just the ends of her tangled hair dipping into the water while with bright eager eyes she caught at one bunch after another of the darling scented rushes  i only hope the boat wont tipple over she said to herself oh what a lovely one only i couldnt quite reach it and it certainly did seem a little provoking almost as if it happened on purpose she thought that though she managed to pick plenty of beautiful rushes as the boat glided by there was always a more lovely one that she couldnt reach  the prettiest are always further she said at last with a sigh at the obstinacy of the rushes in growing so far off as with flushed cheeks and dripping hair and hands she scrambled back into her place and began to arrange her new found treasures  what mattered it to her just then that the rushes had begun to fade and to lose all their scent and beauty from the very moment that she picked them even real scented rushes you know last only a very little while and these being dream rushes melted away almost like snow as they lay in heaps at her feet but alice hardly noticed this there were so many other curious things to think about  they hadnt gone much farther before the blade of one of the oars got fast in the water and wouldnt come out again so alice explained it afterwards and the consequence was that the handle of it caught her under the chin and in spite of a series of little shrieks of oh oh oh from poor alice it swept her straight off the seat and down among the heap of rushes  however she wasnt hurt and was soon up again  the sheep went on with her knitting all the while just as if nothing had happened that was a nice crab you caught she remarked as alice got back into her place very much relieved to find herself still in the boat  was it i didnt see it said alice peeping cautiously over the side of the boat into the dark water i wish it hadnt let go i should so like to see a little crab to take home with me but the sheep only laughed scornfully and went on with her knitting  are there many crabs here said alice  crabs and all sorts of things said the sheep  plenty of choice only make up your mind now what do you want to buy  to buy alice echoed in a tone that was half astonished and half frightened for the oars and the boat and the river had vanished all in a moment and she was back again in the little dark shop  i should like to buy an egg please she said timidly how do you sell them  fivepence farthing for one twopence for two the sheep replied  then two are cheaper than one alice said in a surprised tone taking out her purse  only you must eat them both if you buy two said the sheep  then ill have one please said alice as she put the money down on the counter for she thought to herself they mightnt be at all nice you know  the sheep took the money and put it away in a box  then she said i never put things into peoples hands that would never do you must get it for yourself and so saying she went off to the other end of the shop and set the egg upright on a shelf  i wonder why it wouldnt do thought alice as she groped her way among the tables and chairs for the shop was very dark towards the end the egg seems to get further away the more i walk towards it let me see is this a chair why its got branches i declare how very odd to find trees growing here and actually heres a little brook well this is the very queerest shop i ever saw                                                                                                                   so she went on wondering more and more at every step as everything turned into a tree the moment she came up to it and she quite expected the egg to do the same     chapter vi humpty dumpty   however the egg only got larger and larger and more and more human  when she had come within a few yards of it she saw that it had eyes and a nose and mouth and when she had come close to it she saw clearly that it was humpty dumpty himself it cant be anybody else she said to herself im as certain of it as if his name were written all over his face  it might have been written a hundred times easily on that enormous face humpty dumpty was sitting with his legs crossed like a turk on the top of a high wall such a narrow one that alice quite wondered how he could keep his balance and as his eyes were steadily fixed in the opposite direction and he didnt take the least notice of her she thought he must be a stuffed figure after all  and how exactly like an egg he is she said aloud standing with her hands ready to catch him for she was every moment expecting him to fall  its very provoking humpty dumpty said after a long silence looking away from alice as he spoke to be called an egg very  i said you looked like an egg sir alice gently explained and some eggs are very pretty you know she added hoping to turn her remark into a sort of a compliment  some people said humpty dumpty looking away from her as usual have no more sense than a baby  alice didnt know what to say to this  it wasnt at all like conversation she thought as he never said anything to her in fact his last remark was evidently addressed to a tree so she stood and softly repeated to herself    humpty dumpty sat on a wall  humpty dumpty had a great fall all the kings horses and all the kings men couldnt put humpty dumpty in his place again   that last line is much too long for the poetry she added almost out loud forgetting that humpty dumpty would hear her  dont stand there chattering to yourself like that humpty dumpty said looking at her for the first time but tell me your name and your business  my name is alice but   its a stupid enough name humpty dumpty interrupted impatiently what does it mean  must a name mean something alice asked doubtfully  of course it must humpty dumpty said with a short laugh  my name means the shape i am and a good handsome shape it is too with a name like yours you might be any shape almost  why do you sit out here all alone said alice not wishing to begin an argument  why because theres nobody with me cried humpty dumpty did you think i didnt know the answer to that ask another  dont you think youd be safer down on the ground alice went on not with any idea of making another riddle but simply in her good natured anxiety for the queer creature that wall is so very narrow  what tremendously easy riddles you ask humpty dumpty growled out of course i dont think so why if ever i did fall off which theres no chance of but if i did  here he pursed his lips and looked so solemn and grand that alice could hardly help laughing if i did fall he went on the king has promised me with his very own mouth to to   to send all his horses and all his men alice interrupted rather unwisely  now i declare thats too bad humpty dumpty cried breaking into a sudden passion youve been listening at doors and behind trees and down chimneys or you couldnt have known it  i havent indeed alice said very gently its in a book  ah well they may write such things in a book humpty dumpty said in a calmer tone thats what you call a history of england that is now take a good look at me im one that has spoken to a king i am  mayhap youll never see such another  and to show you im not proud you may shake hands with me and he grinned almost from ear to ear as he leant forwards and as nearly as possible fell off the wall in doing so and offered alice his hand she watched him a little anxiously as she took it if he smiled much more the ends of his mouth might meet behind she thought  and then i dont know what would happen to his head im afraid it would come off  yes all his horses and all his men humpty dumpty went on theyd pick me up again in a minute they would however this conversation is going on a little too fast  lets go back to the last remark but one  im afraid i cant quite remember it alice said very politely  in that case we start fresh said humpty dumpty and its my turn to choose a subject  he talks about it just as if it was a game thought alice so heres a question for you how old did you say you were  alice made a short calculation and said seven years and six months  wrong humpty dumpty exclaimed triumphantly you never said a word like it  i though you meant â€˜how old are you alice explained  if id meant that id have said it said humpty dumpty  alice didnt want to begin another argument so she said nothing  seven years and six months humpty dumpty repeated thoughtfully an uncomfortable sort of age now if youd asked my advice id have said â€˜leave off at seven but its too late now  i never ask advice about growing alice said indignantly  too proud the other inquired  alice felt even more indignant at this suggestion i mean she said that one cant help growing older  one cant perhaps said humpty dumpty but two can with proper assistance you might have left off at seven  what a beautiful belt youve got on alice suddenly remarked  they had had quite enough of the subject of age she thought  and if they really were to take turns in choosing subjects it was her turn now at least she corrected herself on second thoughts a beautiful cravat i should have said no a belt i mean i beg your pardon she added in dismay for humpty dumpty looked thoroughly offended and she began to wish she hadnt chosen that subject if i only knew she thought to herself which was neck and which was waist  evidently humpty dumpty was very angry though he said nothing for a minute or two when he did speak again it was in a deep growl  it is a most provoking thing he said at last when a person doesnt know a cravat from a belt  i know its very ignorant of me alice said in so humble a tone that humpty dumpty relented  its a cravat child and a beautiful one as you say its a present from the white king and queen there now  is it really said alice quite pleased to find that she had chosen a good subject after all  they gave it me humpty dumpty continued thoughtfully as he crossed one knee over the other and clasped his hands round it they gave it me for an un birthday present  i beg your pardon alice said with a puzzled air  im not offended said humpty dumpty  i mean what is an un birthday present  a present given when it isnt your birthday of course  alice considered a little i like birthday presents best she said at last  you dont know what youre talking about cried humpty dumpty how many days are there in a year  three hundred and sixty five said alice  and how many birthdays have you  one  and if you take one from three hundred and sixty five what remains  three hundred and sixty four of course  humpty dumpty looked doubtful id rather see that done on paper he said  alice couldnt help smiling as she took out her memorandum book and worked the sum for him    365     1  364    humpty dumpty took the book and looked at it carefully that seems to be done right  he began  youre holding it upside down alice interrupted  to be sure i was humpty dumpty said gaily as she turned it round for him i thought it looked a little queer as i was saying that seems to be done right though i havent time to look it over thoroughly just now and that shows that there are three hundred and sixty four days when you might get un birthday presents   certainly said alice  and only one for birthday presents you know theres glory for you  i dont know what you mean by â€˜glory alice said  humpty dumpty smiled contemptuously of course you dont till i tell you i meant â€˜theres a nice knock down argument for you  but â€˜glory doesnt mean â€˜a nice knock down argument alice objected  when i use a word humpty dumpty said in rather a scornful tone it means just what i choose it to mean neither more nor less  the question is said alice whether you can make words mean so many different things  the question is said humpty dumpty which is to be master thats all  alice was too much puzzled to say anything so after a minute humpty dumpty began again theyve a temper some of them particularly verbs theyre the proudest adjectives you can do anything with but not verbs however i can manage the whole lot of them impenetrability thats what i say  would you tell me please said alice what that means  now you talk like a reasonable child said humpty dumpty looking very much pleased i meant by â€˜impenetrability that weve had enough of that subject and it would be just as well if youd mention what you mean to do next as i suppose you dont mean to stop here all the rest of your life  thats a great deal to make one word mean alice said in a thoughtful tone  when i make a word do a lot of work like that said humpty dumpty i always pay it extra  oh said alice she was too much puzzled to make any other remark  ah you should see em come round me of a saturday night humpty dumpty went on wagging his head gravely from side to side  for to get their wages you know  alice didnt venture to ask what he paid them with and so you see i cant tell you  you seem very clever at explaining words sir said alice would you kindly tell me the meaning of the poem called â€˜jabberwocky  lets hear it said humpty dumpty i can explain all the poems that were ever invented and a good many that havent been invented just yet  this sounded very hopeful so alice repeated the first verse   twas brillig and the slithy toves     did gyre and gimble in the wabe all mimsy were the borogoves     and the mome raths outgrabe   thats enough to begin with humpty dumpty interrupted  there are plenty of hard words there â€˜brillig means four oclock in the afternoon the time when you begin broiling things for dinner  thatll do very well said alice  and â€˜slithy  well â€˜slithy means â€˜lithe and slimy â€˜lithe is the same as â€˜active you see its like a portmanteau there are two meanings packed up into one word  i see it now alice remarked thoughtfully  and what are â€˜toves  well â€˜toves are something like badgers theyre something like lizards and theyre something like corkscrews  they must be very curious looking creatures  they are that said humpty dumpty  also they make their nests under sun dials also they live on cheese  and whats the â€˜gyre and to â€˜gimble  to â€˜gyre is to go round and round like a gyroscope to â€˜gimble is to make holes like a gimlet  and â€˜the wabe is the grass plot round a sun dial i suppose said alice surprised at her own ingenuity  of course it is its called â€˜wabe you know because it goes a long way before it and a long way behind it   and a long way beyond it on each side alice added  exactly so well then â€˜mimsy is â€˜flimsy and miserable theres another portmanteau for you and a â€˜borogove is a thin shabby looking bird with its feathers sticking out all round something like a live mop  and then â€˜mome raths said alice im afraid im giving you a great deal of trouble  well a â€˜rath is a sort of green pig  but â€˜mome im not certain about i think its short for â€˜from home meaning that theyd lost their way you know  and what does â€˜outgrabe mean  well â€˜outgrabing is something between bellowing and whistling with a kind of sneeze in the middle  however youll hear it done maybe down in the wood yonder and when youve once heard it youll be quite content whos been repeating all that hard stuff to you  i read it in a book said alice but i had some poetry repeated to me much easier than that by tweedledee i think it was  as to poetry you know said humpty dumpty stretching out one of his great hands i can repeat poetry as well as other folk if it comes to that   oh it neednt come to that alice hastily said hoping to keep him from beginning  the piece im going to repeat he went on without noticing her remark was written entirely for your amusement  alice felt that in that case she really ought to listen to it so she sat down and said thank you rather sadly  in winter when the fields are white i sing this song for your delight    only i dont sing it he added as an explanation  i see you dont said alice  if you can see whether im singing or not youve sharper eyes than most humpty dumpty remarked severely alice was silent  in spring when woods are getting green ill try and tell you what i mean   thank you very much said alice  in summer when the days are long perhaps youll understand the song   in autumn when the leaves are brown take pen and ink and write it down   i will if i can remember it so long said alice  you neednt go on making remarks like that humpty dumpty said  theyre not sensible and they put me out  i sent a message to the fish  i told them â€˜this is what i wish  the little fishes of the sea they sent an answer back to me  the little fishes answer was â€˜we cannot do it sir because    im afraid i dont quite understand said alice  it gets easier further on humpty dumpty replied  i sent to them again to say â€˜it will be better to obey  the fishes answered with a grin â€˜why what a temper you are in  i told them once i told them twice  they would not listen to advice  i took a kettle large and new fit for the deed i had to do  my heart went hop my heart went thump i filled the kettle at the pump  then some one came to me and said â€˜the little fishes are in bed  i said to him i said it plain â€˜then you must wake them up again  i said it very loud and clear i went and shouted in his ear   humpty dumpty raised his voice almost to a scream as he repeated this verse and alice thought with a shudder i wouldnt have been the messenger for anything  but he was very stiff and proud he said â€˜you neednt shout so loud  and he was very proud and stiff he said â€˜id go and wake them if   i took a corkscrew from the shelf  i went to wake them up myself  and when i found the door was locked i pulled and pushed and kicked and knocked  and when i found the door was shut i tried to turn the handle but    there was a long pause  is that all alice timidly asked  thats all said humpty dumpty good bye  this was rather sudden alice thought  but after such a very strong hint that she ought to be going she felt that it would hardly be civil to stay so she got up and held out her hand good bye till we meet again she said as cheerfully as she could  i shouldnt know you again if we did meet humpty dumpty replied in a discontented tone giving her one of his fingers to shake youre so exactly like other people  the face is what one goes by generally alice remarked in a thoughtful tone  thats just what i complain of said humpty dumpty your face is the same as everybody has the two eyes so  marking their places in the air with this thumb nose in the middle mouth under its always the same now if you had the two eyes on the same side of the nose for instance or the mouth at the top that would be some help  it wouldnt look nice alice objected but humpty dumpty only shut his eyes and said wait till youve tried  alice waited a minute to see if he would speak again but as he never opened his eyes or took any further notice of her she said good bye once more and getting no answer to this she quietly walked away  but she couldnt help saying to herself as she went of all the unsatisfactory  she repeated this aloud as it was a great comfort to have such a long word to say of all the unsatisfactory people i ever met  she never finished the sentence for at this moment a heavy crash shook the forest from end to end     chapter vii the lion and the unicorn   the next moment soldiers came running through the wood at first in twos and threes then ten or twenty together and at last in such crowds that they seemed to fill the whole forest alice got behind a tree for fear of being run over and watched them go by  she thought that in all her life she had never seen soldiers so uncertain on their feet  they were always tripping over something or other and whenever one went down several more always fell over him so that the ground was soon covered with little heaps of men  then came the horses having four feet these managed rather better than the foot soldiers  but even they stumbled now and then and it seemed to be a regular rule that whenever a horse stumbled the rider fell off instantly the confusion got worse every moment and alice was very glad to get out of the wood into an open place where she found the white king seated on the ground busily writing in his memorandum book  ive sent them all the king cried in a tone of delight on seeing alice did you happen to meet any soldiers my dear as you came through the wood  yes i did said alice  several thousand i should think  four thousand two hundred and seven thats the exact number the king said referring to his book i couldnt send all the horses you know because two of them are wanted in the game and i havent sent the two messengers either theyre both gone to the town just look along the road and tell me if you can see either of them  i see nobody on the road said alice  i only wish i had such eyes the king remarked in a fretful tone to be able to see nobody and at that distance too why its as much as i can do to see real people by this light  all this was lost on alice who was still looking intently along the road shading her eyes with one hand i see somebody now she exclaimed at last but hes coming very slowly and what curious attitudes he goes into for the messenger kept skipping up and down and wriggling like an eel as he came along with his great hands spread out like fans on each side  not at all said the king hes an anglo saxon messenger and those are anglo saxon attitudes he only does them when hes happy his name is haigha he pronounced it so as to rhyme with mayor  i love my love with an h alice couldnt help beginning because he is happy i hate him with an h because he is hideous i fed him with with with ham sandwiches and hay his name is haigha and he lives   he lives on the hill the king remarked simply without the least idea that he was joining in the game while alice was still hesitating for the name of a town beginning with h the other messengers called hatta i must have two you know to come and go one to come and one to go  i beg your pardon said alice  it isnt respectable to beg said the king  i only meant that i didnt understand said alice why one to come and one to go  didnt i tell you the king repeated impatiently i must have two to fetch and carry one to fetch and one to carry  at this moment the messenger arrived  he was far too much out of breath to say a word and could only wave his hands about and make the most fearful faces at the poor king  this young lady loves you with an h the king said introducing alice in the hope of turning off the messengers attention from himself but it was no use the anglo saxon attitudes only got more extraordinary every moment while the great eyes rolled wildly from side to side  you alarm me said the king i feel faint give me a ham sandwich  on which the messenger to alices great amusement opened a bag that hung round his neck and handed a sandwich to the king who devoured it greedily  another sandwich said the king  theres nothing but hay left now the messenger said peeping into the bag  hay then the king murmured in a faint whisper  alice was glad to see that it revived him a good deal theres nothing like eating hay when youre faint he remarked to her as he munched away  i should think throwing cold water over you would be better alice suggested  or some sal volatile  i didnt say there was nothing better the king replied i said there was nothing like it which alice did not venture to deny  who did you pass on the road the king went on holding out his hand to the messenger for some more hay  nobody said the messenger  quite right said the king  this young lady saw him too so of course nobody walks slower than you  i do my best the messenger said in a sulky tone im sure nobody walks much faster than i do  he cant do that said the king or else hed have been here first however now youve got your breath you may tell us whats happened in the town  ill whisper it said the messenger putting his hands to his mouth in the shape of a trumpet and stooping so as to get close to the kings ear alice was sorry for this as she wanted to hear the news too however instead of whispering he simply shouted at the top of his voice theyre at it again  do you call that a whisper cried the poor king jumping up and shaking himself if you do such a thing again ill have you buttered it went through and through my head like an earthquake  it would have to be a very tiny earthquake thought alice who are at it again she ventured to ask  why the lion and the unicorn of course said the king  fighting for the crown  yes to be sure said the king  and the best of the joke is that its my crown all the while lets run and see them and they trotted off alice repeating to herself as she ran the words of the old song    the lion and the unicorn were fighting for the crown  the lion beat the unicorn all round the town some gave them white bread some gave them brown some gave them plum cake and drummed them out of town   does the one that wins get the crown she asked as well as she could for the run was putting her quite out of breath  dear me no said the king what an idea  would you be good enough alice panted out after running a little further to stop a minute just to get ones breath again  im good enough the king said only im not strong enough you see a minute goes by so fearfully quick you might as well try to stop a bandersnatch  alice had no more breath for talking so they trotted on in silence till they came in sight of a great crowd in the middle of which the lion and unicorn were fighting they were in such a cloud of dust that at first alice could not make out which was which  but she soon managed to distinguish the unicorn by his horn  they placed themselves close to where hatta the other messenger was standing watching the fight with a cup of tea in one hand and a piece of bread and butter in the other  hes only just out of prison and he hadnt finished his tea when he was sent in haigha whispered to alice  and they only give them oyster shells in there so you see hes very hungry and thirsty how are you dear child he went on putting his arm affectionately round hattas neck  hatta looked round and nodded and went on with his bread and butter  were you happy in prison dear child said haigha  hatta looked round once more and this time a tear or two trickled down his cheek  but not a word would he say  speak cant you haigha cried impatiently but hatta only munched away and drank some more tea  speak wont you cried the king how are they getting on with the fight  hatta made a desperate effort and swallowed a large piece of bread and butter theyre getting on very well he said in a choking voice  each of them has been down about eighty seven times  then i suppose theyll soon bring the white bread and the brown alice ventured to remark  its waiting for em now said hatta  this is a bit of it as im eating  there was a pause in the fight just then and the lion and the unicorn sat down panting while the king called out ten minutes allowed for refreshments haigha and hatta set to work at once carrying rough trays of white and brown bread alice took a piece to taste but it was very dry  i dont think theyll fight any more to day the king said to hatta  go and order the drums to begin and hatta went bounding away like a grasshopper  for a minute or two alice stood silent watching him suddenly she brightened up look look she cried pointing eagerly theres the white queen running across the country she came flying out of the wood over yonder how fast those queens can run  theres some enemy after her no doubt the king said without even looking round that woods full of them  but arent you going to run and help her alice asked very much surprised at his taking it so quietly  no use no use said the king she runs so fearfully quick you might as well try to catch a bandersnatch but ill make a memorandum about her if you like shes a dear good creature he repeated softly to himself as he opened his memorandum book do you spell â€˜creature with a double â€˜e  at this moment the unicorn sauntered by them with his hands in his pockets i had the best of it this time he said to the king just glancing at him as he passed  a little a little the king replied rather nervously you shouldnt have run him through with your horn you know  it didnt hurt him the unicorn said carelessly and he was going on when his eye happened to fall upon alice  he turned round rather instantly and stood for some time looking at her with an air of the deepest disgust  what is this he said at last  this is a child haigha replied eagerly coming in front of alice to introduce her and spreading out both his hands towards her in an anglo saxon attitude we only found it to day its as large as life and twice as natural  i always thought they were fabulous monsters said the unicorn is it alive  it can talk said haigha solemnly  the unicorn looked dreamily at alice and said talk child  alice could not help her lips curling up into a smile as she began  do you know i always thought unicorns were fabulous monsters too i never saw one alive before  well now that we have seen each other said the unicorn if youll believe in me ill believe in you is that a bargain  yes if you like said alice  come fetch out the plum cake old man the unicorn went on turning from her to the king none of your brown bread for me  certainly certainly the king muttered and beckoned to haigha open the bag he whispered quick not that one thats full of hay  haigha took a large cake out of the bag and gave it to alice to hold while he got out a dish and carving knife how they all came out of it alice couldnt guess it was just like a conjuring trick she thought  the lion had joined them while this was going on  he looked very tired and sleepy and his eyes were half shut whats this he said blinking lazily at alice and speaking in a deep hollow tone that sounded like the tolling of a great bell  ah what is it now the unicorn cried eagerly youll never guess i couldnt  the lion looked at alice wearily are you animal vegetable or mineral he said yawning at every other word  its a fabulous monster the unicorn cried out before alice could reply  then hand round the plum cake monster the lion said lying down and putting his chin on his paws and sit down both of you to the king and the unicorn  fair play with the cake you know  the king was evidently very uncomfortable at having to sit down between the two great creatures but there was no other place for him  what a fight we might have for the crown now the unicorn said looking slyly up at the crown which the poor king was nearly shaking off his head he trembled so much  i should win easy said the lion  im not so sure of that said the unicorn  why i beat you all round the town you chicken the lion replied angrily half getting up as he spoke  here the king interrupted to prevent the quarrel going on  he was very nervous and his voice quite quivered all round the town he said thats a good long way did you go by the old bridge or the market place you get the best view by the old bridge  im sure i dont know the lion growled out as he lay down again there was too much dust to see anything what a time the monster is cutting up that cake  alice had seated herself on the bank of a little brook with the great dish on her knees and was sawing away diligently with the knife its very provoking she said in reply to the lion she was getting quite used to being called the monster ive cut several slices already but they always join on again  you dont know how to manage looking glass cakes the unicorn remarked hand it round first and cut it afterwards  this sounded nonsense but alice very obediently got up and carried the dish round and the cake divided itself into three pieces as she did so now cut it up said the lion as she returned to her place with the empty dish  i say this isnt fair cried the unicorn as alice sat with the knife in her hand very much puzzled how to begin the monster has given the lion twice as much as me  shes kept none for herself anyhow said the lion do you like plum cake monster  but before alice could answer him the drums began  where the noise came from she couldnt make out  the air seemed full of it and it rang through and through her head till she felt quite deafened she started to her feet and sprang across the little brook in her terror                                                                                                                   and had just time to see the lion and the unicorn rise to their feet with angry looks at being interrupted in their feast before she dropped to her knees and put her hands over her ears vainly trying to shut out the dreadful uproar  if that doesnt â€˜drum them out of town she thought to herself nothing ever will    chapter viii its my own invention   after a while the noise seemed gradually to die away till all was dead silence and alice lifted up her head in some alarm there was no one to be seen and her first thought was that she must have been dreaming about the lion and the unicorn and those queer anglo saxon messengers however there was the great dish still lying at her feet on which she had tried to cut the plum cake so i wasnt dreaming after all she said to herself unless unless were all part of the same dream only i do hope its my dream and not the red kings i dont like belonging to another persons dream she went on in a rather complaining tone  ive a great mind to go and wake him and see what happens  at this moment her thoughts were interrupted by a loud shouting of ahoy ahoy check and a knight dressed in crimson armour came galloping down upon her brandishing a great club just as he reached her the horse stopped suddenly  youre my prisoner the knight cried as he tumbled off his horse  startled as she was alice was more frightened for him than for herself at the moment and watched him with some anxiety as he mounted again as soon as he was comfortably in the saddle he began once more youre my  but here another voice broke in ahoy ahoy check and alice looked round in some surprise for the new enemy  this time it was a white knight he drew up at alices side and tumbled off his horse just as the red knight had done  then he got on again and the two knights sat and looked at each other for some time without speaking alice looked from one to the other in some bewilderment  shes my prisoner you know the red knight said at last  yes but then i came and rescued her the white knight replied  well we must fight for her then said the red knight as he took up his helmet which hung from the saddle and was something the shape of a horses head and put it on  you will observe the rules of battle of course the white knight remarked putting on his helmet too  i always do said the red knight and they began banging away at each other with such fury that alice got behind a tree to be out of the way of the blows  i wonder now what the rules of battle are she said to herself as she watched the fight timidly peeping out from her hiding place  one rule seems to be that if one knight hits the other he knocks him off his horse and if he misses he tumbles off himself and another rule seems to be that they hold their clubs with their arms as if they were punch and judy what a noise they make when they tumble just like a whole set of fire irons falling into the fender and how quiet the horses are they let them get on and off them just as if they were tables  another rule of battle that alice had not noticed seemed to be that they always fell on their heads and the battle ended with their both falling off in this way side by side  when they got up again they shook hands and then the red knight mounted and galloped off  it was a glorious victory wasnt it said the white knight as he came up panting  i dont know alice said doubtfully i dont want to be anybodys prisoner i want to be a queen  so you will when youve crossed the next brook said the white knight ill see you safe to the end of the wood and then i must go back you know thats the end of my move  thank you very much said alice may i help you off with your helmet it was evidently more than he could manage by himself however she managed to shake him out of it at last  now one can breathe more easily said the knight putting back his shaggy hair with both hands and turning his gentle face and large mild eyes to alice she thought she had never seen such a strange looking soldier in all her life  he was dressed in tin armour which seemed to fit him very badly and he had a queer shaped little deal box fastened across his shoulder upside down and with the lid hanging open alice looked at it with great curiosity  i see youre admiring my little box the knight said in a friendly tone its my own invention to keep clothes and sandwiches in you see i carry it upside down so that the rain cant get in  but the things can get out alice gently remarked do you know the lids open  i didnt know it the knight said a shade of vexation passing over his face then all the things must have fallen out and the box is no use without them he unfastened it as he spoke and was just going to throw it into the bushes when a sudden thought seemed to strike him and he hung it carefully on a tree can you guess why i did that he said to alice  alice shook her head  in hopes some bees may make a nest in it then i should get the honey  but youve got a bee hive or something like one fastened to the saddle said alice  yes its a very good bee hive the knight said in a discontented tone one of the best kind but not a single bee has come near it yet and the other thing is a mouse trap i suppose the mice keep the bees out or the bees keep the mice out i dont know which  i was wondering what the mouse trap was for said alice it isnt very likely there would be any mice on the horses back  not very likely perhaps said the knight  but if they do come i dont choose to have them running all about  you see he went on after a pause its as well to be provided for everything thats the reason the horse has all those anklets round his feet  but what are they for alice asked in a tone of great curiosity  to guard against the bites of sharks the knight replied its an invention of my own and now help me on ill go with you to the end of the wood whats the dish for  its meant for plum cake said alice  wed better take it with us the knight said itll come in handy if we find any plum cake help me to get it into this bag  this took a very long time to manage though alice held the bag open very carefully because the knight was so very awkward in putting in the dish  the first two or three times that he tried he fell in himself instead its rather a tight fit you see he said as they got it in a last there are so many candlesticks in the bag and he hung it to the saddle which was already loaded with bunches of carrots and fire irons and many other things  i hope youve got your hair well fastened on he continued as they set off  only in the usual way alice said smiling  thats hardly enough he said anxiously you see the wind is so very strong here its as strong as soup  have you invented a plan for keeping the hair from being blown off alice enquired  not yet said the knight but ive got a plan for keeping it from falling off  i should like to hear it very much  first you take an upright stick said the knight then you make your hair creep up it like a fruit tree now the reason hair falls off is because it hangs down things never fall upwards you know its a plan of my own invention you may try it if you like  it didnt sound a comfortable plan alice thought and for a few minutes she walked on in silence puzzling over the idea and every now and then stopping to help the poor knight who certainly was not a good rider  whenever the horse stopped which it did very often he fell off in front and whenever it went on again which it generally did rather suddenly he fell off behind otherwise he kept on pretty well except that he had a habit of now and then falling off sideways and as he generally did this on the side on which alice was walking she soon found that it was the best plan not to walk quite close to the horse  im afraid youve not had much practice in riding she ventured to say as she was helping him up from his fifth tumble  the knight looked very much surprised and a little offended at the remark what makes you say that he asked as he scrambled back into the saddle keeping hold of alices hair with one hand to save himself from falling over on the other side  because people dont fall off quite so often when theyve had much practice  ive had plenty of practice the knight said very gravely  plenty of practice  alice could think of nothing better to say than indeed but she said it as heartily as she could they went on a little way in silence after this the knight with his eyes shut muttering to himself and alice watching anxiously for the next tumble  the great art of riding the knight suddenly began in a loud voice waving his right arm as he spoke is to keep  here the sentence ended as suddenly as it had begun as the knight fell heavily on the top of his head exactly in the path where alice was walking she was quite frightened this time and said in an anxious tone as she picked him up i hope no bones are broken  none to speak of the knight said as if he didnt mind breaking two or three of them the great art of riding as i was saying is to keep your balance properly like this you know   he let go the bridle and stretched out both his arms to show alice what he meant and this time he fell flat on his back right under the horses feet  plenty of practice he went on repeating all the time that alice was getting him on his feet again plenty of practice  its too ridiculous cried alice losing all her patience this time you ought to have a wooden horse on wheels that you ought  does that kind go smoothly the knight asked in a tone of great interest clasping his arms round the horses neck as he spoke just in time to save himself from tumbling off again  much more smoothly than a live horse alice said with a little scream of laughter in spite of all she could do to prevent it  ill get one the knight said thoughtfully to himself one or two several  there was a short silence after this and then the knight went on again im a great hand at inventing things now i daresay you noticed that last time you picked me up that i was looking rather thoughtful  you were a little grave said alice  well just then i was inventing a new way of getting over a gate would you like to hear it  very much indeed alice said politely  ill tell you how i came to think of it said the knight you see i said to myself â€˜the only difficulty is with the feet  the head is high enough already now first i put my head on the top of the gate then i stand on my head then the feet are high enough you see then im over you see  yes i suppose youd be over when that was done alice said thoughtfully  but dont you think it would be rather hard  i havent tried it yet the knight said gravely  so i cant tell for certain but im afraid it would be a little hard  he looked so vexed at the idea that alice changed the subject hastily what a curious helmet youve got she said cheerfully is that your invention too  the knight looked down proudly at his helmet which hung from the saddle yes he said but ive invented a better one than that like a sugar loaf when i used to wear it if i fell off the horse it always touched the ground directly so i had a very little way to fall you see but there was the danger of falling into it to be sure that happened to me once and the worst of it was before i could get out again the other white knight came and put it on he thought it was his own helmet  the knight looked so solemn about it that alice did not dare to laugh im afraid you must have hurt him she said in a trembling voice being on the top of his head  i had to kick him of course the knight said very seriously and then he took the helmet off again but it took hours and hours to get me out i was as fast as as lightning you know  but thats a different kind of fastness alice objected  the knight shook his head it was all kinds of fastness with me i can assure you he said he raised his hands in some excitement as he said this and instantly rolled out of the saddle and fell headlong into a deep ditch  alice ran to the side of the ditch to look for him she was rather startled by the fall as for some time he had kept on very well and she was afraid that he really was hurt this time however though she could see nothing but the soles of his feet she was much relieved to hear that he was talking on in his usual tone all kinds of fastness he repeated  but it was careless of him to put another mans helmet on with the man in it too  how can you go on talking so quietly head downwards alice asked as she dragged him out by the feet and laid him in a heap on the bank  the knight looked surprised at the question what does it matter where my body happens to be he said my mind goes on working all the same in fact the more head downwards i am the more i keep inventing new things  now the cleverest thing of the sort that i ever did he went on after a pause was inventing a new pudding during the meat course  in time to have it cooked for the next course said alice well not the next course the knight said in a slow thoughtful tone  no certainly not the next course  then it would have to be the next day i suppose you wouldnt have two pudding courses in one dinner  well not the next day the knight repeated as before  not the next day in fact he went on holding his head down and his voice getting lower and lower i dont believe that pudding ever was cooked in fact i dont believe that pudding ever will be cooked and yet it was a very clever pudding to invent  what did you mean it to be made of alice asked hoping to cheer him up for the poor knight seemed quite low spirited about it  it began with blotting paper the knight answered with a groan  that wouldnt be very nice im afraid   not very nice alone he interrupted quite eagerly  but youve no idea what a difference it makes mixing it with other things such as gunpowder and sealing wax and here i must leave you they had just come to the end of the wood  alice could only look puzzled  she was thinking of the pudding  you are sad the knight said in an anxious tone  let me sing you a song to comfort you  is it very long alice asked for she had heard a good deal of poetry that day  its long said the knight but very very beautiful everybody that hears me sing it either it brings the tears into their eyes or else   or else what said alice for the knight had made a sudden pause  or else it doesnt you know the name of the song is called â€˜haddocks eyes  oh thats the name of the song is it alice said trying to feel interested  no you dont understand the knight said looking a little vexed thats what the name is called the name really is â€˜the aged aged man  then i ought to have said â€˜thats what the song is called alice corrected herself  no you oughtnt  thats quite another thing the song is called â€˜ways and means  but thats only what its called you know  well what is the song then said alice who was by this time completely bewildered  i was coming to that the knight said the song really is â€˜a sitting on a gate  and the tunes my own invention  so saying he stopped his horse and let the reins fall on its neck  then slowly beating time with one hand and with a faint smile lighting up his gentle foolish face as if he enjoyed the music of his song he began  of all the strange things that alice saw in her journey through the looking glass this was the one that she always remembered most clearly years afterwards she could bring the whole scene back again as if it had been only yesterday the mild blue eyes and kindly smile of the knight the setting sun gleaming through his hair and shining on his armour in a blaze of light that quite dazzled her the horse quietly moving about with the reins hanging loose on his neck cropping the grass at her feet and the black shadows of the forest behind all this she took in like a picture as with one hand shading her eyes she leant against a tree watching the strange pair and listening in a half dream to the melancholy music of the song  but the tune isnt his own invention she said to herself  its â€˜i give thee all i can no more she stood and listened very attentively but no tears came into her eyes  ill tell thee everything i can     theres little to relate i saw an aged aged man     a sitting on a gate â€˜who are you aged man i said     â€˜and how is it you live and his answer trickled through my head     like water through a sieve  he said â€˜i look for butterflies     that sleep among the wheat  i make them into mutton pies     and sell them in the street i sell them unto men he said     â€˜who sail on stormy seas and thats the way i get my bread      a trifle if you please  but i was thinking of a plan     to dye ones whiskers green and always use so large a fan     that they could not be seen so having no reply to give     to what the old man said i cried â€˜come tell me how you live     and thumped him on the head  his accents mild took up the tale      he said â€˜i go my ways and when i find a mountain rill     i set it in a blaze and thence they make a stuff they call     rolands macassar oil  yet twopence halfpenny is all     they give me for my toil  but i was thinking of a way     to feed oneself on batter and so go on from day to day     getting a little fatter i shook him well from side to side     until his face was blue  â€˜come tell me how you live i cried     â€˜and what it is you do  he said â€˜i hunt for haddocks eyes     among the heather bright and work them into waistcoat buttons     in the silent night and these i do not sell for gold     or coin of silvery shine but for a copper halfpenny     and that will purchase nine  â€˜i sometimes dig for buttered rolls     or set limed twigs for crabs i sometimes search the grassy knolls     for wheels of hansom cabs and thats the way he gave a wink     â€˜by which i get my wealth  and very gladly will i drink     your honours noble health  i heard him then for i had just     completed my design to keep the menai bridge from rust     by boiling it in wine i thanked him much for telling me     the way he got his wealth but chiefly for his wish that he     might drink my noble health  and now if eer by chance i put     my fingers into glue or madly squeeze a right hand foot     into a left hand shoe or if i drop upon my toe     a very heavy weight i weep for it reminds me so of that old man i used to know  whose look was mild whose speech was slow whose hair was whiter than the snow whose face was very like a crow with eyes like cinders all aglow who seemed distracted with his woe who rocked his body to and fro and muttered mumblingly and low as if his mouth were full of dough who snorted like a buffalo  that summer evening long ago     a sitting on a gate   as the knight sang the last words of the ballad he gathered up the reins and turned his horses head along the road by which they had come youve only a few yards to go he said down the hill and over that little brook and then youll be a queen but youll stay and see me off first he added as alice turned with an eager look in the direction to which he pointed i shant be long youll wait and wave your handkerchief when i get to that turn in the road i think itll encourage me you see  of course ill wait said alice  and thank you very much for coming so far and for the song i liked it very much  i hope so the knight said doubtfully  but you didnt cry so much as i thought you would  so they shook hands and then the knight rode slowly away into the forest it wont take long to see him off i expect alice said to herself as she stood watching him there he goes right on his head as usual however he gets on again pretty easily that comes of having so many things hung round the horse  so she went on talking to herself as she watched the horse walking leisurely along the road and the knight tumbling off first on one side and then on the other after the fourth or fifth tumble he reached the turn and then she waved her handkerchief to him and waited till he was out of sight  i hope it encouraged him she said as she turned to run down the hill  and now for the last brook and to be a queen how grand it sounds a very few steps brought her to the edge of the brook the eighth square at last she cried as she bounded across                                                                                                                   and threw herself down to rest on a lawn as soft as moss with little flower beds dotted about it here and there oh how glad i am to get here and what is this on my head she exclaimed in a tone of dismay as she put her hands up to something very heavy and fitted tight all round her head  but how can it have got there without my knowing it she said to herself as she lifted it off and set it on her lap to make out what it could possibly be  it was a golden crown     chapter ix queen alice   well this is grand said alice i never expected i should be a queen so soon and ill tell you what it is your majesty she went on in a severe tone she was always rather fond of scolding herself itll never do for you to be lolling about on the grass like that queens have to be dignified you know  so she got up and walked about rather stiffly just at first as she was afraid that the crown might come off  but she comforted herself with the thought that there was nobody to see her and if i really am a queen she said as she sat down again i shall be able to manage it quite well in time  everything was happening so oddly that she didnt feel a bit surprised at finding the red queen and the white queen sitting close to her one on each side  she would have liked very much to ask them how they came there but she feared it would not be quite civil however there would be no harm she thought in asking if the game was over please would you tell me  she began looking timidly at the red queen  speak when youre spoken to the queen sharply interrupted her  but if everybody obeyed that rule said alice who was always ready for a little argument and if you only spoke when you were spoken to and the other person always waited for you to begin you see nobody would ever say anything so that   ridiculous cried the queen why dont you see child  here she broke off with a frown and after thinking for a minute suddenly changed the subject of the conversation what do you mean by â€˜if you really are a queen what right have you to call yourself so you cant be a queen you know till youve passed the proper examination and the sooner we begin it the better  i only said â€˜if poor alice pleaded in a piteous tone  the two queens looked at each other and the red queen remarked with a little shudder she says she only said â€˜if   but she said a great deal more than that the white queen moaned wringing her hands oh ever so much more than that  so you did you know the red queen said to alice always speak the truth think before you speak and write it down afterwards  im sure i didnt mean  alice was beginning but the red queen interrupted her impatiently  thats just what i complain of you should have meant what do you suppose is the use of child without any meaning even a joke should have some meaning and a childs more important than a joke i hope you couldnt deny that even if you tried with both hands  i dont deny things with my hands alice objected  nobody said you did said the red queen i said you couldnt if you tried  shes in that state of mind said the white queen that she wants to deny something only she doesnt know what to deny  a nasty vicious temper the red queen remarked and then there was an uncomfortable silence for a minute or two  the red queen broke the silence by saying to the white queen i invite you to alices dinner party this afternoon  the white queen smiled feebly and said and i invite you  i didnt know i was to have a party at all said alice but if there is to be one i think i ought to invite the guests  we gave you the opportunity of doing it the red queen remarked  but i daresay youve not had many lessons in manners yet  manners are not taught in lessons said alice lessons teach you to do sums and things of that sort  and you do addition the white queen asked whats one and one and one and one and one and one and one and one and one and one  i dont know said alice i lost count  she cant do addition the red queen interrupted can you do subtraction take nine from eight  nine from eight i cant you know alice replied very readily  but   she cant do subtraction said the white queen can you do division divide a loaf by a knife whats the answer to that  i suppose  alice was beginning but the red queen answered for her bread and butter of course try another subtraction sum take a bone from a dog  what remains  alice considered the bone wouldnt remain of course if i took it and the dog wouldnt remain it would come to bite me and im sure i shouldnt remain  then you think nothing would remain said the red queen  i think thats the answer  wrong as usual said the red queen  the dogs temper would remain  but i dont see how   why look here the red queen cried the dog would lose its temper wouldnt it  perhaps it would alice replied cautiously  then if the dog went away its temper would remain the queen exclaimed triumphantly  alice said as gravely as she could they might go different ways but she couldnt help thinking to herself what dreadful nonsense we are talking  she cant do sums a bit the queens said together with great emphasis  can you do sums alice said turning suddenly on the white queen for she didnt like being found fault with so much  the queen gasped and shut her eyes i can do addition if you give me time but i cant do subtraction under any circumstances  of course you know your a b c said the red queen  to be sure i do said alice  so do i the white queen whispered  well often say it over together dear and ill tell you a secret i can read words of one letter isnt that grand however dont be discouraged youll come to it in time  here the red queen began again can you answer useful questions she said how is bread made  i know that alice cried eagerly you take some flour   where do you pick the flower the white queen asked in a garden or in the hedges  well it isnt picked at all alice explained  its ground   how many acres of ground said the white queen you mustnt leave out so many things  fan her head the red queen anxiously interrupted shell be feverish after so much thinking so they set to work and fanned her with bunches of leaves till she had to beg them to leave off it blew her hair about so  shes all right again now said the red queen do you know languages whats the french for fiddle de dee  fiddle de dees not english alice replied gravely  who ever said it was said the red queen  alice thought she saw a way out of the difficulty this time if youll tell me what language â€˜fiddle de dee is ill tell you the french for it she exclaimed triumphantly  but the red queen drew herself up rather stiffly and said queens never make bargains  i wish queens never asked questions alice thought to herself  dont let us quarrel the white queen said in an anxious tone what is the cause of lightning  the cause of lightning alice said very decidedly for she felt quite certain about this is the thunder no no she hastily corrected herself i meant the other way  its too late to correct it said the red queen  when youve once said a thing that fixes it and you must take the consequences  which reminds me  the white queen said looking down and nervously clasping and unclasping her hands we had such a thunderstorm last tuesday i mean one of the last set of tuesdays you know  alice was puzzled in our country she remarked theres only one day at a time  the red queen said thats a poor thin way of doing things now here we mostly have days and nights two or three at a time and sometimes in the winter we take as many as five nights together for warmth you know  are five nights warmer than one night then alice ventured to ask  five times as warm of course  but they should be five times as cold by the same rule   just so cried the red queen five times as warm and five times as cold just as im five times as rich as you are and five times as clever  alice sighed and gave it up its exactly like a riddle with no answer she thought  humpty dumpty saw it too the white queen went on in a low voice more as if she were talking to herself he came to the door with a corkscrew in his hand   what did he want said the red queen  he said he would come in the white queen went on because he was looking for a hippopotamus now as it happened there wasnt such a thing in the house that morning  is there generally alice asked in an astonished tone  well only on thursdays said the queen  i know what he came for said alice  he wanted to punish the fish because   here the white queen began again it was such a thunderstorm you cant think she never could you know said the red queen and part of the roof came off and ever so much thunder got in and it went rolling round the room in great lumps and knocking over the tables and things till i was so frightened i couldnt remember my own name  alice thought to herself i never should try to remember my name in the middle of an accident where would be the use of it but she did not say this aloud for fear of hurting the poor queens feeling  your majesty must excuse her the red queen said to alice taking one of the white queens hands in her own and gently stroking it  she means well but she cant help saying foolish things as a general rule  the white queen looked timidly at alice who felt she ought to say something kind but really couldnt think of anything at the moment  she never was really well brought up the red queen went on  but its amazing how good tempered she is pat her on the head and see how pleased shell be but this was more than alice had courage to do  a little kindness and putting her hair in papers would do wonders with her   the white queen gave a deep sigh and laid her head on alices shoulder i am so sleepy she moaned  shes tired poor thing said the red queen smooth her hair lend her your nightcap and sing her a soothing lullaby  i havent got a nightcap with me said alice as she tried to obey the first direction  and i dont know any soothing lullabies  i must do it myself then said the red queen and she began   hush a by lady in alices lap till the feasts ready weve time for a nap  when the feasts over well go to the ball  red queen and white queen and alice and all   and now you know the words she added as she put her head down on alices other shoulder just sing it through to me im getting sleepy too in another moment both queens were fast asleep and snoring loud  what am i to do exclaimed alice looking about in great perplexity as first one round head and then the other rolled down from her shoulder and lay like a heavy lump in her lap i dont think it ever happened before that any one had to take care of two queens asleep at once no not in all the history of england it couldnt you know because there never was more than one queen at a time do wake up you heavy things she went on in an impatient tone but there was no answer but a gentle snoring  the snoring got more distinct every minute and sounded more like a tune  at last she could even make out the words and she listened so eagerly that when the two great heads vanished from her lap she hardly missed them  she was standing before an arched doorway over which were the words queen alice in large letters and on each side of the arch there was a bell handle one was marked visitors bell and the other servants bell  ill wait till the songs over thought alice and then ill ring the which bell must i ring she went on very much puzzled by the names im not a visitor and im not a servant there ought to be one marked â€˜queen you know   just then the door opened a little way and a creature with a long beak put its head out for a moment and said no admittance till the week after next and shut the door again with a bang  alice knocked and rang in vain for a long time but at last a very old frog who was sitting under a tree got up and hobbled slowly towards her  he was dressed in bright yellow and had enormous boots on  what is it now the frog said in a deep hoarse whisper  alice turned round ready to find fault with anybody wheres the servant whose business it is to answer the door she began angrily  which door said the frog  alice almost stamped with irritation at the slow drawl in which he spoke this door of course  the frog looked at the door with his large dull eyes for a minute  then he went nearer and rubbed it with his thumb as if he were trying whether the paint would come off then he looked at alice  to answer the door he said whats it been asking of he was so hoarse that alice could scarcely hear him  i dont know what you mean she said  i talks english doesnt i the frog went on or are you deaf what did it ask you  nothing alice said impatiently ive been knocking at it  shouldnt do that shouldnt do that  the frog muttered vexes it you know then he went up and gave the door a kick with one of his great feet you let it alone he panted out as he hobbled back to his tree and itll let you alone you know  at this moment the door was flung open and a shrill voice was heard singing   to the looking glass world it was alice that said â€˜ive a sceptre in hand ive a crown on my head let the looking glass creatures whatever they be come and dine with the red queen the white queen and me   and hundreds of voices joined in the chorus   then fill up the glasses as quick as you can and sprinkle the table with buttons and bran  put cats in the coffee and mice in the tea  and welcome queen alice with thirty times three   then followed a confused noise of cheering and alice thought to herself thirty times three makes ninety i wonder if any ones counting in a minute there was silence again and the same shrill voice sang another verse  â€˜o looking glass creatures quoth alice â€˜draw near tis an honour to see me a favour to hear  tis a privilege high to have dinner and tea along with the red queen the white queen and me   then came the chorus again    then fill up the glasses with treacle and ink or anything else that is pleasant to drink  mix sand with the cider and wool with the wine  and welcome queen alice with ninety times nine   ninety times nine alice repeated in despair oh thatll never be done id better go in at once  and there was a dead silence the moment she appeared  alice glanced nervously along the table as she walked up the large hall and noticed that there were about fifty guests of all kinds  some were animals some birds and there were even a few flowers among them im glad theyve come without waiting to be asked she thought  i should never have known who were the right people to invite  there were three chairs at the head of the table the red and white queens had already taken two of them but the middle one was empty alice sat down in it rather uncomfortable in the silence and longing for some one to speak  at last the red queen began youve missed the soup and fish she said put on the joint and the waiters set a leg of mutton before alice who looked at it rather anxiously as she had never had to carve a joint before  you look a little shy let me introduce you to that leg of mutton said the red queen alice mutton mutton alice the leg of mutton got up in the dish and made a little bow to alice and alice returned the bow not knowing whether to be frightened or amused  may i give you a slice she said taking up the knife and fork and looking from one queen to the other  certainly not the red queen said very decidedly  it isnt etiquette to cut any one youve been introduced to remove the joint and the waiters carried it off and brought a large plum pudding in its place  i wont be introduced to the pudding please alice said rather hastily or we shall get no dinner at all may i give you some  but the red queen looked sulky and growled pudding alice alice pudding remove the pudding and the waiters took it away so quickly that alice couldnt return its bow  however she didnt see why the red queen should be the only one to give orders so as an experiment she called out waiter bring back the pudding and there it was again in a moment like a conjuring trick it was so large that she couldnt help feeling a little shy with it as she had been with the mutton however she conquered her shyness by a great effort and cut a slice and handed it to the red queen  what impertinence said the pudding i wonder how youd like it if i were to cut a slice out of you you creature  it spoke in a thick suety sort of voice and alice hadnt a word to say in reply  she could only sit and look at it and gasp  make a remark said the red queen  its ridiculous to leave all the conversation to the pudding  do you know ive had such a quantity of poetry repeated to me to day alice began a little frightened at finding that the moment she opened her lips there was dead silence and all eyes were fixed upon her and its a very curious thing i think every poem was about fishes in some way do you know why theyre so fond of fishes all about here  she spoke to the red queen whose answer was a little wide of the mark as to fishes she said very slowly and solemnly putting her mouth close to alices ear her white majesty knows a lovely riddle all in poetry all about fishes shall she repeat it  her red majestys very kind to mention it the white queen murmured into alices other ear in a voice like the cooing of a pigeon it would be such a treat may i  please do alice said very politely  the white queen laughed with delight and stroked alices cheek then she began       â€˜first the fish must be caught that is easy  a baby i think could have caught it     â€˜next the fish must be bought that is easy  a penny i think would have bought it      â€˜now cook me the fish that is easy and will not take more than a minute     â€˜let it lie in a dish that is easy because it already is in it      â€˜bring it here let me sup it is easy to set such a dish on the table     â€˜take the dish cover up ah that is so hard that i fear im unable      for it holds it like glue  holds the lid to the dish while it lies in the middle      which is easiest to do un dish cover the fish or dishcover the riddle   take a minute to think about it and then guess said the red queen meanwhile well drink your health queen alices health she screamed at the top of her voice and all the guests began drinking it directly and very queerly they managed it  some of them put their glasses upon their heads like extinguishers and drank all that trickled down their faces others upset the decanters and drank the wine as it ran off the edges of the table and three of them who looked like kangaroos scrambled into the dish of roast mutton and began eagerly lapping up the gravy just like pigs in a trough thought alice  you ought to return thanks in a neat speech the red queen said frowning at alice as she spoke  we must support you you know the white queen whispered as alice got up to do it very obediently but a little frightened  thank you very much she whispered in reply but i can do quite well without  that wouldnt be at all the thing the red queen said very decidedly  so alice tried to submit to it with a good grace  and they did push so she said afterwards when she was telling her sister the history of the feast you would have thought they wanted to squeeze me flat  in fact it was rather difficult for her to keep in her place while she made her speech  the two queens pushed her so one on each side that they nearly lifted her up into the air  i rise to return thanks  alice began  and she really did rise as she spoke several inches but she got hold of the edge of the table and managed to pull herself down again  take care of yourself screamed the white queen seizing alices hair with both her hands somethings going to happen  and then as alice afterwards described it all sorts of things happened in a moment the candles all grew up to the ceiling looking something like a bed of rushes with fireworks at the top as to the bottles they each took a pair of plates which they hastily fitted on as wings and so with forks for legs went fluttering about in all directions  and very like birds they look alice thought to herself as well as she could in the dreadful confusion that was beginning  at this moment she heard a hoarse laugh at her side and turned to see what was the matter with the white queen but instead of the queen there was the leg of mutton sitting in the chair here i am cried a voice from the soup tureen and alice turned again just in time to see the queens broad good natured face grinning at her for a moment over the edge of the tureen before she disappeared into the soup  there was not a moment to be lost already several of the guests were lying down in the dishes and the soup ladle was walking up the table towards alices chair and beckoning to her impatiently to get out of its way  i cant stand this any longer she cried as she jumped up and seized the table cloth with both hands  one good pull and plates dishes guests and candles came crashing down together in a heap on the floor  and as for you she went on turning fiercely upon the red queen whom she considered as the cause of all the mischief but the queen was no longer at her side she had suddenly dwindled down to the size of a little doll and was now on the table merrily running round and round after her own shawl which was trailing behind her  at any other time alice would have felt surprised at this but she was far too much excited to be surprised at anything now as for you she repeated catching hold of the little creature in the very act of jumping over a bottle which had just lighted upon the table ill shake you into a kitten that i will     chapter x shaking   she took her off the table as she spoke and shook her backwards and forwards with all her might  the red queen made no resistance whatever only her face grew very small and her eyes got large and green  and still as alice went on shaking her she kept on growing shorter and fatter and softer and rounder and      chapter xi waking    and it really was a kitten after all     chapter xii which dreamed it   your majesty shouldnt purr so loud alice said rubbing her eyes and addressing the kitten respectfully yet with some severity you woke me out of oh such a nice dream and youve been along with me kitty all through the looking glass world did you know it dear  it is a very inconvenient habit of kittens alice had once made the remark that whatever you say to them they always purr if they would only purr for â€˜yes and mew for â€˜no or any rule of that sort she had said so that one could keep up a conversation but how can you talk with a person if they always say the same thing  on this occasion the kitten only purred  and it was impossible to guess whether it meant yes or no  so alice hunted among the chessmen on the table till she had found the red queen  then she went down on her knees on the hearth rug and put the kitten and the queen to look at each other now kitty she cried clapping her hands triumphantly confess that was what you turned into  but it wouldnt look at it she said when she was explaining the thing afterwards to her sister  it turned away its head and pretended not to see it  but it looked a little ashamed of itself so i think it must have been the red queen  sit up a little more stiffly dear alice cried with a merry laugh and curtsey while youre thinking what to what to purr it saves time remember and she caught it up and gave it one little kiss just in honour of having been a red queen  snowdrop my pet she went on looking over her shoulder at the white kitten which was still patiently undergoing its toilet when will dinah have finished with your white majesty i wonder that must be the reason you were so untidy in my dream dinah do you know that youre scrubbing a white queen really its most disrespectful of you  and what did dinah turn to i wonder she prattled on as she settled comfortably down with one elbow in the rug and her chin in her hand to watch the kittens tell me dinah did you turn to humpty dumpty i think you did however youd better not mention it to your friends just yet for im not sure  by the way kitty if only youd been really with me in my dream there was one thing you would have enjoyed i had such a quantity of poetry said to me all about fishes to morrow morning you shall have a real treat all the time youre eating your breakfast ill repeat â€˜the walrus and the carpenter to you and then you can make believe its oysters dear  now kitty lets consider who it was that dreamed it all this is a serious question my dear and you should not go on licking your paw like that as if dinah hadnt washed you this morning you see kitty it must have been either me or the red king he was part of my dream of course but then i was part of his dream too was it the red king kitty you were his wife my dear so you ought to know oh kitty do help to settle it im sure your paw can wait but the provoking kitten only began on the other paw and pretended it hadnt heard the question  which do you think it was   a boat beneath a sunny sky lingering onward dreamily in an evening of july   children three that nestle near eager eye and willing ear pleased a simple tale to hear   long has paled that sunny sky  echoes fade and memories die autumn frosts have slain july  still she haunts me phantomwise alice moving under skies never seen by waking eyes  children yet the tale to hear eager eye and willing ear lovingly shall nestle near  in a wonderland they lie dreaming as the days go by dreaming as the summers die   ever drifting down the stream  lingering in the golden gleam  life what is it but a dream"@"through the looking glass"@"lewis carroll"
