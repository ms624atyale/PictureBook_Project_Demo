"mrs rachel lynde lived just where the avonlea main road dipped down into a little hollow fringed with alders and ladies eardrops and traversed by a brook that had its source away back in the woods of the old cuthbert place it was reputed to be an intricate headlong brook in its earlier course through those woods with dark secrets of pool and cascade but by the time it reached lyndes hollow it was a quiet well conducted little stream for not even a brook could run past mrs rachel lyndes door without due regard for decency and decorum it probably was conscious that mrs rachel was sitting at her window keeping a sharp eye on everything that passed from brooks and children up and that if she noticed anything odd or out of place she would never rest until she had ferreted out the whys and wherefores thereof  there are plenty of people in avonlea and out of it who can attend closely to their neighbors business by dint of neglecting their own but mrs rachel lynde was one of those capable creatures who can manage their own concerns and those of other folks into the bargain she was a notable housewife her work was always done and well done she ran the sewing circle helped run the sunday school and was the strongest prop of the church aid society and foreign missions auxiliary yet with all this mrs rachel found abundant time to sit for hours at her kitchen window knitting cotton warp quilts she had knitted sixteen of them as avonlea housekeepers were wont to tell in awed voices and keeping a sharp eye on the main road that crossed the hollow and wound up the steep red hill beyond since avonlea occupied a little triangular peninsula jutting out into the gulf of st lawrence with water on two sides of it anybody who went out of it or into it had to pass over that hill road and so run the unseen gauntlet of mrs rachels all seeing eye  she was sitting there one afternoon in early june the sun was coming in at the window warm and bright the orchard on the slope below the house was in a bridal flush of pinky white bloom hummed over by a myriad of bees thomas lynde a meek little man whom avonlea people called rachel lyndes husband was sowing his late turnip seed on the hill field beyond the barn and matthew cuthbert ought to have been sowing his on the big red brook field away over by green gables mrs rachel knew that he ought because she had heard him tell peter morrison the evening before in william j blairs store over at carmody that he meant to sow his turnip seed the next afternoon peter had asked him of course for matthew cuthbert had never been known to volunteer information about anything in his whole life  and yet here was matthew cuthbert at half past three on the afternoon of a busy day placidly driving over the hollow and up the hill moreover he wore a white collar and his best suit of clothes which was plain proof that he was going out of avonlea and he had the buggy and the sorrel mare which betokened that he was going a considerable distance now where was matthew cuthbert going and why was he going there  had it been any other man in avonlea mrs rachel deftly putting this and that together might have given a pretty good guess as to both questions but matthew so rarely went from home that it must be something pressing and unusual which was taking him he was the shyest man alive and hated to have to go among strangers or to any place where he might have to talk matthew dressed up with a white collar and driving in a buggy was something that didnt happen often mrs rachel ponder as she might could make nothing of it and her afternoons enjoyment was spoiled  ill just step over to green gables after tea and find out from marilla where hes gone and why the worthy woman finally concluded he doesnt generally go to town this time of year and he never visits if hed run out of turnip seed he wouldnt dress up and take the buggy to go for more he wasnt driving fast enough to be going for a doctor yet something must have happened since last night to start him off im clean puzzled thats what and i wont know a minutes peace of mind or conscience until i know what has taken matthew cuthbert out of avonlea today  accordingly after tea mrs rachel set out she had not far to go the big rambling orchard embowered house where the cuthberts lived was a scant quarter of a mile up the road from lyndes hollow to be sure the long lane made it a good deal further matthew cuthberts father as shy and silent as his son after him had got as far away as he possibly could from his fellow men without actually retreating into the woods when he founded his homestead green gables was built at the furthest edge of his cleared land and there it was to this day barely visible from the main road along which all the other avonlea houses were so sociably situated mrs rachel lynde did not call living in such a place living at all  its just staying thats what she said as she stepped along the deep rutted grassy lane bordered with wild rose bushes its no wonder matthew and marilla are both a little odd living away back here by themselves trees arent much company though dear knows if they were thered be enough of them id ruther look at people to be sure they seem contented enough but then i suppose theyre used to it a body can get used to anything even to being hanged as the irishman said  with this mrs rachel stepped out of the lane into the backyard of green gables very green and neat and precise was that yard set about on one side with great patriarchal willows and on the other with prim lombardies not a stray stick nor stone was to be seen for mrs rachel would have seen it if there had been privately she was of the opinion that marilla cuthbert swept that yard over as often as she swept her house one could have eaten a meal off the ground without overbrimming the proverbial peck of dirt  mrs rachel rapped smartly at the kitchen door and stepped in when bidden to do so the kitchen at green gables was a cheerful apartment or would have been cheerful if it had not been so painfully clean as to give it something of the appearance of an unused parlor its windows looked east and west through the west one looking out on the back yard came a flood of mellow june sunlight but the east one whence you got a glimpse of the bloom white cherry trees in the left orchard and nodding slender birches down in the hollow by the brook was greened over by a tangle of vines here sat marilla cuthbert when she sat at all always slightly distrustful of sunshine which seemed to her too dancing and irresponsible a thing for a world which was meant to be taken seriously and here she sat now knitting and the table behind her was laid for supper  mrs rachel before she had fairly closed the door had taken a mental note of everything that was on that table there were three plates laid so that marilla must be expecting some one home with matthew to tea but the dishes were everyday dishes and there was only crab apple preserves and one kind of cake so that the expected company could not be any particular company yet what of matthews white collar and the sorrel mare mrs rachel was getting fairly dizzy with this unusual mystery about quiet unmysterious green gables  good evening rachel marilla said briskly this is a real fine evening isnt it wont you sit down how are all your folks  something that for lack of any other name might be called friendship existed and always had existed between marilla cuthbert and mrs rachel in spite of or perhaps because of their dissimilarity  marilla was a tall thin woman with angles and without curves her dark hair showed some gray streaks and was always twisted up in a hard little knot behind with two wire hairpins stuck aggressively through it she looked like a woman of narrow experience and rigid conscience which she was but there was a saving something about her mouth which if it had been ever so slightly developed might have been considered indicative of a sense of humor  were all pretty well said mrs rachel i was kind of afraid you werent though when i saw matthew starting off today i thought maybe he was going to the doctors  marillas lips twitched understandingly she had expected mrs rachel up she had known that the sight of matthew jaunting off so unaccountably would be too much for her neighbors curiosity  oh no im quite well although i had a bad headache yesterday she said matthew went to bright river were getting a little boy from an orphan asylum in nova scotia and hes coming on the train tonight  if marilla had said that matthew had gone to bright river to meet a kangaroo from australia mrs rachel could not have been more astonished she was actually stricken dumb for five seconds it was unsupposable that marilla was making fun of her but mrs rachel was almost forced to suppose it  are you in earnest marilla she demanded when voice returned to her  yes of course said marilla as if getting boys from orphan asylums in nova scotia were part of the usual spring work on any well regulated avonlea farm instead of being an unheard of innovation  mrs rachel felt that she had received a severe mental jolt she thought in exclamation points a boy marilla and matthew cuthbert of all people adopting a boy from an orphan asylum well the world was certainly turning upside down she would be surprised at nothing after this nothing  what on earth put such a notion into your head she demanded disapprovingly  this had been done without her advice being asked and must perforce be disapproved  well weve been thinking about it for some time all winter in fact  returned marilla mrs alexander spencer was up here one day before christmas and she said she was going to get a little girl from the asylum over in hopeton in the spring her cousin lives there and mrs spencer has visited her and knows all about it so matthew and i have talked it over off and on ever since we thought wed get a boy matthew is getting up in years you know hes sixty and he isnt so spry as he once was his heart troubles him a good deal and you know how desperate hard its got to be to get hired help theres never anybody to be had but those stupid half grown little french boys and as soon as you do get one broke into your ways and taught something hes up and off to the lobster canneries or the states at first matthew suggested getting a home boy but i said ‘no flat to that ‘they may be all right im not saying theyre not but no london street arabs for me i said ‘give me a native born at least therell be a risk no matter who we get but ill feel easier in my mind and sleep sounder at nights if we get a born canadian so in the end we decided to ask mrs spencer to pick us out one when she went over to get her little girl we heard last week she was going so we sent her word by richard spencers folks at carmody to bring us a smart likely boy of about ten or eleven we decided that would be the best age old enough to be of some use in doing chores right off and young enough to be trained up proper we mean to give him a good home and schooling we had a telegram from mrs alexander spencer today the mail man brought it from the station saying they were coming on the five thirty train tonight so matthew went to bright river to meet him mrs spencer will drop him off there of course she goes on to white sands station herself  mrs rachel prided herself on always speaking her mind she proceeded to speak it now having adjusted her mental attitude to this amazing piece of news  well marilla ill just tell you plain that i think youre doing a mighty foolish thing a risky thing thats what you dont know what youre getting youre bringing a strange child into your house and home and you dont know a single thing about him nor what his disposition is like nor what sort of parents he had nor how hes likely to turn out why it was only last week i read in the paper how a man and his wife up west of the island took a boy out of an orphan asylum and he set fire to the house at night set it on purpose marilla and nearly burnt them to a crisp in their beds and i know another case where an adopted boy used to suck the eggs they couldnt break him of it if you had asked my advice in the matter which you didnt do marilla id have said for mercys sake not to think of such a thing thats what  this jobs comforting seemed neither to offend nor to alarm marilla she knitted steadily on  i dont deny theres something in what you say rachel ive had some qualms myself but matthew was terrible set on it i could see that so i gave in its so seldom matthew sets his mind on anything that when he does i always feel its my duty to give in and as for the risk theres risks in pretty near everything a body does in this world theres risks in peoples having children of their own if it comes to that they dont always turn out well and then nova scotia is right close to the island it isnt as if we were getting him from england or the states he cant be much different from ourselves  well i hope it will turn out all right said mrs rachel in a tone that plainly indicated her painful doubts only dont say i didnt warn you if he burns green gables down or puts strychnine in the well i heard of a case over in new brunswick where an orphan asylum child did that and the whole family died in fearful agonies only it was a girl in that instance  well were not getting a girl said marilla as if poisoning wells were a purely feminine accomplishment and not to be dreaded in the case of a boy id never dream of taking a girl to bring up i wonder at mrs alexander spencer for doing it but there she wouldnt shrink from adopting a whole orphan asylum if she took it into her head  mrs rachel would have liked to stay until matthew came home with his imported orphan but reflecting that it would be a good two hours at least before his arrival she concluded to go up the road to robert bells and tell the news it would certainly make a sensation second to none and mrs rachel dearly loved to make a sensation so she took herself away somewhat to marillas relief for the latter felt her doubts and fears reviving under the influence of mrs rachels pessimism  well of all things that ever were or will be ejaculated mrs rachel when she was safely out in the lane it does really seem as if i must be dreaming well im sorry for that poor young one and no mistake matthew and marilla dont know anything about children and theyll expect him to be wiser and steadier than his own grandfather if so bes he ever had a grandfather which is doubtful it seems uncanny to think of a child at green gables somehow theres never been one there for matthew and marilla were grown up when the new house was built if they ever were children which is hard to believe when one looks at them i wouldnt be in that orphans shoes for anything my but i pity him thats what  so said mrs rachel to the wild rose bushes out of the fulness of her heart but if she could have seen the child who was waiting patiently at the bright river station at that very moment her pity would have been still deeper and more profound     chapter ii matthew cuthbert is surprised   matthew cuthbert and the sorrel mare jogged comfortably over the eight miles to bright river it was a pretty road running along between snug farmsteads with now and again a bit of balsamy fir wood to drive through or a hollow where wild plums hung out their filmy bloom the air was sweet with the breath of many apple orchards and the meadows sloped away in the distance to horizon mists of pearl and purple while       the little birds sang as if it were      the one day of summer in all the year  matthew enjoyed the drive after his own fashion except during the moments when he met women and had to nod to them for in prince edward island you are supposed to nod to all and sundry you meet on the road whether you know them or not  matthew dreaded all women except marilla and mrs rachel he had an uncomfortable feeling that the mysterious creatures were secretly laughing at him he may have been quite right in thinking so for he was an odd looking personage with an ungainly figure and long iron gray hair that touched his stooping shoulders and a full soft brown beard which he had worn ever since he was twenty in fact he had looked at twenty very much as he looked at sixty lacking a little of the grayness  when he reached bright river there was no sign of any train he thought he was too early so he tied his horse in the yard of the small bright river hotel and went over to the station house the long platform was almost deserted the only living creature in sight being a girl who was sitting on a pile of shingles at the extreme end matthew barely noting that it was a girl sidled past her as quickly as possible without looking at her had he looked he could hardly have failed to notice the tense rigidity and expectation of her attitude and expression she was sitting there waiting for something or somebody and since sitting and waiting was the only thing to do just then she sat and waited with all her might and main  matthew encountered the stationmaster locking up the ticket office preparatory to going home for supper and asked him if the five thirty train would soon be along  the five thirty train has been in and gone half an hour ago answered that brisk official but there was a passenger dropped off for you a little girl shes sitting out there on the shingles i asked her to go into the ladies waiting room but she informed me gravely that she preferred to stay outside ‘there was more scope for imagination she said shes a case i should say  im not expecting a girl said matthew blankly its a boy ive come for he should be here mrs alexander spencer was to bring him over from nova scotia for me  the stationmaster whistled  guess theres some mistake he said mrs spencer came off the train with that girl and gave her into my charge said you and your sister were adopting her from an orphan asylum and that you would be along for her presently thats all i know about it and i havent got any more orphans concealed hereabouts  i dont understand said matthew helplessly wishing that marilla was at hand to cope with the situation  well youd better question the girl said the stationmaster carelessly i dare say shell be able to explain shes got a tongue of her own thats certain maybe they were out of boys of the brand you wanted  he walked jauntily away being hungry and the unfortunate matthew was left to do that which was harder for him than bearding a lion in its den walk up to a girl a strange girl an orphan girl and demand of her why she wasnt a boy matthew groaned in spirit as he turned about and shuffled gently down the platform towards her  she had been watching him ever since he had passed her and she had her eyes on him now matthew was not looking at her and would not have seen what she was really like if he had been but an ordinary observer would have seen this  a child of about eleven garbed in a very short very tight very ugly dress of yellowish gray wincey she wore a faded brown sailor hat and beneath the hat extending down her back were two braids of very thick decidedly red hair her face was small white and thin also much freckled her mouth was large and so were her eyes which looked green in some lights and moods and gray in others  so far the ordinary observer an extraordinary observer might have seen that the chin was very pointed and pronounced that the big eyes were full of spirit and vivacity that the mouth was sweet lipped and expressive that the forehead was broad and full in short our discerning extraordinary observer might have concluded that no commonplace soul inhabited the body of this stray woman child of whom shy matthew cuthbert was so ludicrously afraid  matthew however was spared the ordeal of speaking first for as soon as she concluded that he was coming to her she stood up grasping with one thin brown hand the handle of a shabby old fashioned carpet bag the other she held out to him  i suppose you are mr matthew cuthbert of green gables she said in a peculiarly clear sweet voice im very glad to see you i was beginning to be afraid you werent coming for me and i was imagining all the things that might have happened to prevent you i had made up my mind that if you didnt come for me tonight id go down the track to that big wild cherry tree at the bend and climb up into it to stay all night i wouldnt be a bit afraid and it would be lovely to sleep in a wild cherry tree all white with bloom in the moonshine dont you think you could imagine you were dwelling in marble halls couldnt you and i was quite sure you would come for me in the morning if you didnt tonight  matthew had taken the scrawny little hand awkwardly in his then and there he decided what to do he could not tell this child with the glowing eyes that there had been a mistake he would take her home and let marilla do that she couldnt be left at bright river anyhow no matter what mistake had been made so all questions and explanations might as well be deferred until he was safely back at green gables  im sorry i was late he said shyly come along the horse is over in the yard give me your bag  oh i can carry it the child responded cheerfully it isnt heavy ive got all my worldly goods in it but it isnt heavy and if it isnt carried in just a certain way the handle pulls out so id better keep it because i know the exact knack of it its an extremely old carpet bag oh im very glad youve come even if it would have been nice to sleep in a wild cherry tree weve got to drive a long piece havent we mrs spencer said it was eight miles im glad because i love driving oh it seems so wonderful that im going to live with you and belong to you ive never belonged to anybody not really but the asylum was the worst ive only been in it four months but that was enough i dont suppose you ever were an orphan in an asylum so you cant possibly understand what it is like its worse than anything you could imagine mrs spencer said it was wicked of me to talk like that but i didnt mean to be wicked its so easy to be wicked without knowing it isnt it they were good you know the asylum people but there is so little scope for the imagination in an asylum only just in the other orphans it was pretty interesting to imagine things about them to imagine that perhaps the girl who sat next to you was really the daughter of a belted earl who had been stolen away from her parents in her infancy by a cruel nurse who died before she could confess i used to lie awake at nights and imagine things like that because i didnt have time in the day i guess thats why im so thin i am dreadful thin aint i there isnt a pick on my bones i do love to imagine im nice and plump with dimples in my elbows  with this matthews companion stopped talking partly because she was out of breath and partly because they had reached the buggy not another word did she say until they had left the village and were driving down a steep little hill the road part of which had been cut so deeply into the soft soil that the banks fringed with blooming wild cherry trees and slim white birches were several feet above their heads  the child put out her hand and broke off a branch of wild plum that brushed against the side of the buggy  isnt that beautiful what did that tree leaning out from the bank all white and lacy make you think of she asked  well now i dunno said matthew  why a bride of course a bride all in white with a lovely misty veil ive never seen one but i can imagine what she would look like i dont ever expect to be a bride myself im so homely nobody will ever want to marry me unless it might be a foreign missionary i suppose a foreign missionary mightnt be very particular but i do hope that some day i shall have a white dress that is my highest ideal of earthly bliss i just love pretty clothes and ive never had a pretty dress in my life that i can remember but of course its all the more to look forward to isnt it and then i can imagine that im dressed gorgeously this morning when i left the asylum i felt so ashamed because i had to wear this horrid old wincey dress all the orphans had to wear them you know a merchant in hopeton last winter donated three hundred yards of wincey to the asylum some people said it was because he couldnt sell it but id rather believe that it was out of the kindness of his heart wouldnt you when we got on the train i felt as if everybody must be looking at me and pitying me but i just went to work and imagined that i had on the most beautiful pale blue silk dress because when you are imagining you might as well imagine something worth while and a big hat all flowers and nodding plumes and a gold watch and kid gloves and boots i felt cheered up right away and i enjoyed my trip to the island with all my might i wasnt a bit sick coming over in the boat neither was mrs spencer although she generally is she said she hadnt time to get sick watching to see that i didnt fall overboard she said she never saw the beat of me for prowling about but if it kept her from being seasick its a mercy i did prowl isnt it and i wanted to see everything that was to be seen on that boat because i didnt know whether id ever have another opportunity oh there are a lot more cherry trees all in bloom this island is the bloomiest place i just love it already and im so glad im going to live here ive always heard that prince edward island was the prettiest place in the world and i used to imagine i was living here but i never really expected i would its delightful when your imaginations come true isnt it but those red roads are so funny when we got into the train at charlottetown and the red roads began to flash past i asked mrs spencer what made them red and she said she didnt know and for pitys sake not to ask her any more questions she said i must have asked her a thousand already i suppose i had too but how are you going to find out about things if you dont ask questions and what does make the roads red  well now i dunno said matthew  well that is one of the things to find out sometime isnt it splendid to think of all the things there are to find out about it just makes me feel glad to be alive its such an interesting world it wouldnt be half so interesting if we knew all about everything would it thered be no scope for imagination then would there but am i talking too much people are always telling me i do would you rather i didnt talk if you say so ill stop i can stop when i make up my mind to it although its difficult  matthew much to his own surprise was enjoying himself like most quiet folks he liked talkative people when they were willing to do the talking themselves and did not expect him to keep up his end of it but he had never expected to enjoy the society of a little girl women were bad enough in all conscience but little girls were worse he detested the way they had of sidling past him timidly with sidewise glances as if they expected him to gobble them up at a mouthful if they ventured to say a word that was the avonlea type of well bred little girl but this freckled witch was very different and although he found it rather difficult for his slower intelligence to keep up with her brisk mental processes he thought that he kind of liked her chatter so he said as shyly as usual   oh you can talk as much as you like i dont mind  oh im so glad i know you and i are going to get along together fine its such a relief to talk when one wants to and not be told that children should be seen and not heard ive had that said to me a million times if i have once and people laugh at me because i use big words but if you have big ideas you have to use big words to express them havent you  well now that seems reasonable said matthew  mrs spencer said that my tongue must be hung in the middle but it isnt its firmly fastened at one end mrs spencer said your place was named green gables i asked her all about it and she said there were trees all around it i was gladder than ever i just love trees and there werent any at all about the asylum only a few poor weeny teeny things out in front with little whitewashed cagey things about them they just looked like orphans themselves those trees did it used to make me want to cry to look at them i used to say to them ‘oh you poor little things if you were out in a great big woods with other trees all around you and little mosses and june bells growing over your roots and a brook not far away and birds singing in your branches you could grow couldnt you but you cant where you are i know just exactly how you feel little trees i felt sorry to leave them behind this morning you do get so attached to things like that dont you is there a brook anywhere near green gables i forgot to ask mrs spencer that  well now yes theres one right below the house  fancy its always been one of my dreams to live near a brook i never expected i would though dreams dont often come true do they wouldnt it be nice if they did but just now i feel pretty nearly perfectly happy i cant feel exactly perfectly happy because well what color would you call this  she twitched one of her long glossy braids over her thin shoulder and held it up before matthews eyes matthew was not used to deciding on the tints of ladies tresses but in this case there couldnt be much doubt  its red aint it he said  the girl let the braid drop back with a sigh that seemed to come from her very toes and to exhale forth all the sorrows of the ages  yes its red she said resignedly now you see why i cant be perfectly happy nobody could who has red hair i dont mind the other things so much the freckles and the green eyes and my skinniness i can imagine them away i can imagine that i have a beautiful rose leaf complexion and lovely starry violet eyes but i cannot imagine that red hair away i do my best i think to myself ‘now my hair is a glorious black black as the ravens wing but all the time i know it is just plain red and it breaks my heart it will be my lifelong sorrow i read of a girl once in a novel who had a lifelong sorrow but it wasnt red hair her hair was pure gold rippling back from her alabaster brow what is an alabaster brow i never could find out can you tell me  well now im afraid i cant said matthew who was getting a little dizzy he felt as he had once felt in his rash youth when another boy had enticed him on the merry go round at a picnic  well whatever it was it must have been something nice because she was divinely beautiful have you ever imagined what it must feel like to be divinely beautiful  well now no i havent confessed matthew ingenuously  i have often which would you rather be if you had the choice divinely beautiful or dazzlingly clever or angelically good  well now i i dont know exactly  neither do i i can never decide but it doesnt make much real difference for it isnt likely ill ever be either its certain ill never be angelically good mrs spencer says oh mr cuthbert oh mr cuthbert oh mr cuthbert  that was not what mrs spencer had said neither had the child tumbled out of the buggy nor had matthew done anything astonishing they had simply rounded a curve in the road and found themselves in the avenue  the avenue so called by the newbridge people was a stretch of road four or five hundred yards long completely arched over with huge wide spreading apple trees planted years ago by an eccentric old farmer overhead was one long canopy of snowy fragrant bloom below the boughs the air was full of a purple twilight and far ahead a glimpse of painted sunset sky shone like a great rose window at the end of a cathedral aisle  its beauty seemed to strike the child dumb she leaned back in the buggy her thin hands clasped before her her face lifted rapturously to the white splendor above even when they had passed out and were driving down the long slope to newbridge she never moved or spoke still with rapt face she gazed afar into the sunset west with eyes that saw visions trooping splendidly across that glowing background through newbridge a bustling little village where dogs barked at them and small boys hooted and curious faces peered from the windows they drove still in silence when three more miles had dropped away behind them the child had not spoken she could keep silence it was evident as energetically as she could talk  i guess youre feeling pretty tired and hungry matthew ventured to say at last accounting for her long visitation of dumbness with the only reason he could think of but we havent very far to go now only another mile  she came out of her reverie with a deep sigh and looked at him with the dreamy gaze of a soul that had been wondering afar star led  oh mr cuthbert she whispered that place we came through that white place what was it  well now you must mean the avenue said matthew after a few moments profound reflection it is a kind of pretty place  pretty oh pretty doesnt seem the right word to use nor beautiful either they dont go far enough oh it was wonderful wonderful its the first thing i ever saw that couldnt be improved upon by imagination it just satisfied me here she put one hand on her breast it made a queer funny ache and yet it was a pleasant ache did you ever have an ache like that mr cuthbert  well now i just cant recollect that i ever had  i have it lots of times whenever i see anything royally beautiful but they shouldnt call that lovely place the avenue there is no meaning in a name like that they should call it let me see the white way of delight isnt that a nice imaginative name when i dont like the name of a place or a person i always imagine a new one and always think of them so there was a girl at the asylum whose name was hepzibah jenkins but i always imagined her as rosalia devere other people may call that place the avenue but i shall always call it the white way of delight have we really only another mile to go before we get home im glad and im sorry im sorry because this drive has been so pleasant and im always sorry when pleasant things end something still pleasanter may come after but you can never be sure and its so often the case that it isnt pleasanter that has been my experience anyhow but im glad to think of getting home you see ive never had a real home since i can remember it gives me that pleasant ache again just to think of coming to a really truly home oh isnt that pretty  they had driven over the crest of a hill below them was a pond looking almost like a river so long and winding was it a bridge spanned it midway and from there to its lower end where an amber hued belt of sand hills shut it in from the dark blue gulf beyond the water was a glory of many shifting hues the most spiritual shadings of crocus and rose and ethereal green with other elusive tintings for which no name has ever been found above the bridge the pond ran up into fringing groves of fir and maple and lay all darkly translucent in their wavering shadows here and there a wild plum leaned out from the bank like a white clad girl tiptoeing to her own reflection from the marsh at the head of the pond came the clear mournfully sweet chorus of the frogs there was a little gray house peering around a white apple orchard on a slope beyond and although it was not yet quite dark a light was shining from one of its windows  thats barrys pond said matthew  oh i dont like that name either i shall call it let me see the lake of shining waters yes that is the right name for it i know because of the thrill when i hit on a name that suits exactly it gives me a thrill do things ever give you a thrill  matthew ruminated  well now yes it always kind of gives me a thrill to see them ugly white grubs that spade up in the cucumber beds i hate the look of them  oh i dont think that can be exactly the same kind of a thrill do you think it can there doesnt seem to be much connection between grubs and lakes of shining waters does there but why do other people call it barrys pond  i reckon because mr barry lives up there in that house orchard slopes the name of his place if it wasnt for that big bush behind it you could see green gables from here but we have to go over the bridge and round by the road so its near half a mile further  has mr barry any little girls well not so very little either about my size  hes got one about eleven her name is diana  oh with a long indrawing of breath what a perfectly lovely name  well now i dunno theres something dreadful heathenish about it seems to me id ruther jane or mary or some sensible name like that but when diana was born there was a schoolmaster boarding there and they gave him the naming of her and he called her diana  i wish there had been a schoolmaster like that around when i was born then oh here we are at the bridge im going to shut my eyes tight im always afraid going over bridges i cant help imagining that perhaps just as we get to the middle theyll crumple up like a jack knife and nip us so i shut my eyes but i always have to open them for all when i think were getting near the middle because you see if the bridge did crumple up id want to see it crumple what a jolly rumble it makes i always like the rumble part of it isnt it splendid there are so many things to like in this world there were over now ill look back good night dear lake of shining waters i always say good night to the things i love just as i would to people i think they like it that water looks as if it was smiling at me  when they had driven up the further hill and around a corner matthew said   were pretty near home now thats green gables over   oh dont tell me she interrupted breathlessly catching at his partially raised arm and shutting her eyes that she might not see his gesture let me guess im sure ill guess right  she opened her eyes and looked about her they were on the crest of a hill the sun had set some time since but the landscape was still clear in the mellow afterlight to the west a dark church spire rose up against a marigold sky below was a little valley and beyond a long gently rising slope with snug farmsteads scattered along it from one to another the childs eyes darted eager and wistful at last they lingered on one away to the left far back from the road dimly white with blossoming trees in the twilight of the surrounding woods over it in the stainless southwest sky a great crystal white star was shining like a lamp of guidance and promise  thats it isnt it she said pointing  matthew slapped the reins on the sorrels back delightedly  well now youve guessed it but i reckon mrs spencer described it sos you could tell  no she didnt really she didnt all she said might just as well have been about most of those other places i hadnt any real idea what it looked like but just as soon as i saw it i felt it was home oh it seems as if i must be in a dream do you know my arm must be black and blue from the elbow up for ive pinched myself so many times today every little while a horrible sickening feeling would come over me and id be so afraid it was all a dream then id pinch myself to see if it was real until suddenly i remembered that even supposing it was only a dream id better go on dreaming as long as i could so i stopped pinching but it is real and were nearly home  with a sigh of rapture she relapsed into silence matthew stirred uneasily he felt glad that it would be marilla and not he who would have to tell this waif of the world that the home she longed for was not to be hers after all they drove over lyndes hollow where it was already quite dark but not so dark that mrs rachel could not see them from her window vantage and up the hill and into the long lane of green gables by the time they arrived at the house matthew was shrinking from the approaching revelation with an energy he did not understand it was not of marilla or himself he was thinking or of the trouble this mistake was probably going to make for them but of the childs disappointment when he thought of that rapt light being quenched in her eyes he had an uncomfortable feeling that he was going to assist at murdering something much the same feeling that came over him when he had to kill a lamb or calf or any other innocent little creature  the yard was quite dark as they turned into it and the poplar leaves were rustling silkily all round it  listen to the trees talking in their sleep she whispered as he lifted her to the ground what nice dreams they must have  then holding tightly to the carpet bag which contained all her worldly goods she followed him into the house     chapter iii marilla cuthbert is surprised   marilla came briskly forward as matthew opened the door but when her eyes fell on the odd little figure in the stiff ugly dress with the long braids of red hair and the eager luminous eyes she stopped short in amazement  matthew cuthbert whos that she ejaculated where is the boy  there wasnt any boy said matthew wretchedly there was only her  he nodded at the child remembering that he had never even asked her name  no boy but there must have been a boy insisted marilla we sent word to mrs spencer to bring a boy  well she didnt she brought her i asked the stationmaster and i had to bring her home she couldnt be left there no matter where the mistake had come in  well this is a pretty piece of business ejaculated marilla  during this dialogue the child had remained silent her eyes roving from one to the other all the animation fading out of her face suddenly she seemed to grasp the full meaning of what had been said dropping her precious carpet bag she sprang forward a step and clasped her hands  you dont want me she cried you dont want me because im not a boy i might have expected it nobody ever did want me i might have known it was all too beautiful to last i might have known nobody really did want me oh what shall i do im going to burst into tears  burst into tears she did sitting down on a chair by the table flinging her arms out upon it and burying her face in them she proceeded to cry stormily marilla and matthew looked at each other deprecatingly across the stove neither of them knew what to say or do finally marilla stepped lamely into the breach  well well theres no need to cry so about it  yes there is need the child raised her head quickly revealing a tear stained face and trembling lips you would cry too if you were an orphan and had come to a place you thought was going to be home and found that they didnt want you because you werent a boy oh this is the most tragical thing that ever happened to me  something like a reluctant smile rather rusty from long disuse mellowed marillas grim expression  well dont cry any more were not going to turn you out of doors tonight youll have to stay here until we investigate this affair whats your name  the child hesitated for a moment  will you please call me cordelia she said eagerly  call you cordelia is that your name  no o o its not exactly my name but i would love to be called cordelia its such a perfectly elegant name  i dont know what on earth you mean if cordelia isnt your name what is  anne shirley reluctantly faltered forth the owner of that name but oh please do call me cordelia it cant matter much to you what you call me if im only going to be here a little while can it and anne is such an unromantic name  unromantic fiddlesticks said the unsympathetic marilla anne is a real good plain sensible name youve no need to be ashamed of it  oh im not ashamed of it explained anne only i like cordelia better ive always imagined that my name was cordelia at least i always have of late years when i was young i used to imagine it was geraldine but i like cordelia better now but if you call me anne please call me anne spelled with an e  what difference does it make how its spelled asked marilla with another rusty smile as she picked up the teapot  oh it makes such a difference it looks so much nicer when you hear a name pronounced cant you always see it in your mind just as if it was printed out i can and a n n looks dreadful but a n n e looks so much more distinguished if youll only call me anne spelled with an e i shall try to reconcile myself to not being called cordelia  very well then anne spelled with an e can you tell us how this mistake came to be made we sent word to mrs spencer to bring us a boy were there no boys at the asylum  oh yes there was an abundance of them but mrs spencer said distinctly that you wanted a girl about eleven years old and the matron said she thought i would do you dont know how delighted i was i couldnt sleep all last night for joy oh she added reproachfully turning to matthew why didnt you tell me at the station that you didnt want me and leave me there if i hadnt seen the white way of delight and the lake of shining waters it wouldnt be so hard  what on earth does she mean demanded marilla staring at matthew  she shes just referring to some conversation we had on the road  said matthew hastily im going out to put the mare in marilla have tea ready when i come back  did mrs spencer bring anybody over besides you continued marilla when matthew had gone out  she brought lily jones for herself lily is only five years old and she is very beautiful and had nut brown hair if i was very beautiful and had nut brown hair would you keep me  no we want a boy to help matthew on the farm a girl would be of no use to us take off your hat ill lay it and your bag on the hall table  anne took off her hat meekly matthew came back presently and they sat down to supper but anne could not eat in vain she nibbled at the bread and butter and pecked at the crab apple preserve out of the little scalloped glass dish by her plate she did not really make any headway at all  youre not eating anything said marilla sharply eying her as if it were a serious shortcoming anne sighed  i cant im in the depths of despair can you eat when you are in the depths of despair  ive never been in the depths of despair so i cant say responded marilla  werent you well did you ever try to imagine you were in the depths of despair  no i didnt  then i dont think you can understand what its like its a very uncomfortable feeling indeed when you try to eat a lump comes right up in your throat and you cant swallow anything not even if it was a chocolate caramel i had one chocolate caramel once two years ago and it was simply delicious ive often dreamed since then that i had a lot of chocolate caramels but i always wake up just when im going to eat them i do hope you wont be offended because i cant eat everything is extremely nice but still i cannot eat  i guess shes tired said matthew who hadnt spoken since his return from the barn best put her to bed marilla  marilla had been wondering where anne should be put to bed she had prepared a couch in the kitchen chamber for the desired and expected boy but although it was neat and clean it did not seem quite the thing to put a girl there somehow but the spare room was out of the question for such a stray waif so there remained only the east gable room marilla lighted a candle and told anne to follow her which anne spiritlessly did taking her hat and carpet bag from the hall table as she passed the hall was fearsomely clean the little gable chamber in which she presently found herself seemed still cleaner  marilla set the candle on a three legged three cornered table and turned down the bedclothes  i suppose you have a nightgown she questioned  anne nodded  yes i have two the matron of the asylum made them for me theyre fearfully skimpy there is never enough to go around in an asylum so things are always skimpy at least in a poor asylum like ours i hate skimpy night dresses but one can dream just as well in them as in lovely trailing ones with frills around the neck thats one consolation  well undress as quick as you can and go to bed ill come back in a few minutes for the candle i darent trust you to put it out yourself youd likely set the place on fire  when marilla had gone anne looked around her wistfully the whitewashed walls were so painfully bare and staring that she thought they must ache over their own bareness the floor was bare too except for a round braided mat in the middle such as anne had never seen before in one corner was the bed a high old fashioned one with four dark low turned posts in the other corner was the aforesaid three cornered table adorned with a fat red velvet pincushion hard enough to turn the point of the most adventurous pin above it hung a little six by eight mirror midway between table and bed was the window with an icy white muslin frill over it and opposite it was the wash stand the whole apartment was of a rigidity not to be described in words but which sent a shiver to the very marrow of annes bones with a sob she hastily discarded her garments put on the skimpy nightgown and sprang into bed where she burrowed face downward into the pillow and pulled the clothes over her head when marilla came up for the light various skimpy articles of raiment scattered most untidily over the floor and a certain tempestuous appearance of the bed were the only indications of any presence save her own  she deliberately picked up annes clothes placed them neatly on a prim yellow chair and then taking up the candle went over to the bed  good night she said a little awkwardly but not unkindly  annes white face and big eyes appeared over the bedclothes with a startling suddenness  how can you call it a good night when you know it must be the very worst night ive ever had she said reproachfully  then she dived down into invisibility again  marilla went slowly down to the kitchen and proceeded to wash the supper dishes matthew was smoking a sure sign of perturbation of mind he seldom smoked for marilla set her face against it as a filthy habit but at certain times and seasons he felt driven to it and then marilla winked at the practice realizing that a mere man must have some vent for his emotions  well this is a pretty kettle of fish she said wrathfully this is what comes of sending word instead of going ourselves richard spencers folks have twisted that message somehow one of us will have to drive over and see mrs spencer tomorrow thats certain this girl will have to be sent back to the asylum  yes i suppose so said matthew reluctantly  you suppose so dont you know it  well now shes a real nice little thing marilla its kind of a pity to send her back when shes so set on staying here  matthew cuthbert you dont mean to say you think we ought to keep her  marillas astonishment could not have been greater if matthew had expressed a predilection for standing on his head  well now no i suppose not not exactly stammered matthew uncomfortably driven into a corner for his precise meaning i suppose we could hardly be expected to keep her  i should say not what good would she be to us  we might be some good to her said matthew suddenly and unexpectedly  matthew cuthbert i believe that child has bewitched you i can see as plain as plain that you want to keep her  well now shes a real interesting little thing persisted matthew you should have heard her talk coming from the station  oh she can talk fast enough i saw that at once its nothing in her favor either i dont like children who have so much to say i dont want an orphan girl and if i did she isnt the style id pick out theres something i dont understand about her no shes got to be despatched straightway back to where she came from  i could hire a french boy to help me said matthew and shed be company for you  im not suffering for company said marilla shortly and im not going to keep her  well now its just as you say of course marilla said matthew rising and putting his pipe away im going to bed  to bed went matthew and to bed when she had put her dishes away went marilla frowning most resolutely and up stairs in the east gable a lonely heart hungry friendless child cried herself to sleep     chapter iv morning at green gables   it was broad daylight when anne awoke and sat up in bed staring confusedly at the window through which a flood of cheery sunshine was pouring and outside of which something white and feathery waved across glimpses of blue sky  for a moment she could not remember where she was first came a delightful thrill as of something very pleasant then a horrible remembrance this was green gables and they didnt want her because she wasnt a boy  but it was morning and yes it was a cherry tree in full bloom outside of her window with a bound she was out of bed and across the floor she pushed up the sash it went up stiffly and creakily as if it hadnt been opened for a long time which was the case and it stuck so tight that nothing was needed to hold it up  anne dropped on her knees and gazed out into the june morning her eyes glistening with delight oh wasnt it beautiful wasnt it a lovely place suppose she wasnt really going to stay here she would imagine she was there was scope for imagination here  a huge cherry tree grew outside so close that its boughs tapped against the house and it was so thick set with blossoms that hardly a leaf was to be seen on both sides of the house was a big orchard one of apple trees and one of cherry trees also showered over with blossoms and their grass was all sprinkled with dandelions in the garden below were lilac trees purple with flowers and their dizzily sweet fragrance drifted up to the window on the morning wind  below the garden a green field lush with clover sloped down to the hollow where the brook ran and where scores of white birches grew upspringing airily out of an undergrowth suggestive of delightful possibilities in ferns and mosses and woodsy things generally beyond it was a hill green and feathery with spruce and fir there was a gap in it where the gray gable end of the little house she had seen from the other side of the lake of shining waters was visible  off to the left were the big barns and beyond them away down over green low sloping fields was a sparkling blue glimpse of sea  annes beauty loving eyes lingered on it all taking everything greedily in she had looked on so many unlovely places in her life poor child but this was as lovely as anything she had ever dreamed  she knelt there lost to everything but the loveliness around her until she was startled by a hand on her shoulder marilla had come in unheard by the small dreamer  its time you were dressed she said curtly  marilla really did not know how to talk to the child and her uncomfortable ignorance made her crisp and curt when she did not mean to be  anne stood up and drew a long breath  oh isnt it wonderful she said waving her hand comprehensively at the good world outside  its a big tree said marilla and it blooms great but the fruit dont amount to much never small and wormy  oh i dont mean just the tree of course its lovely yes its radiantly lovely it blooms as if it meant it but i meant everything the garden and the orchard and the brook and the woods the whole big dear world dont you feel as if you just loved the world on a morning like this and i can hear the brook laughing all the way up here have you ever noticed what cheerful things brooks are theyre always laughing even in winter time ive heard them under the ice im so glad theres a brook near green gables perhaps you think it doesnt make any difference to me when youre not going to keep me but it does i shall always like to remember that there is a brook at green gables even if i never see it again if there wasnt a brook id be haunted by the uncomfortable feeling that there ought to be one im not in the depths of despair this morning i never can be in the morning isnt it a splendid thing that there are mornings but i feel very sad ive just been imagining that it was really me you wanted after all and that i was to stay here for ever and ever it was a great comfort while it lasted but the worst of imagining things is that the time comes when you have to stop and that hurts  youd better get dressed and come down stairs and never mind your imaginings said marilla as soon as she could get a word in edgewise breakfast is waiting wash your face and comb your hair leave the window up and turn your bedclothes back over the foot of the bed be as smart as you can  anne could evidently be smart to some purpose for she was down stairs in ten minutes time with her clothes neatly on her hair brushed and braided her face washed and a comfortable consciousness pervading her soul that she had fulfilled all marillas requirements as a matter of fact however she had forgotten to turn back the bedclothes  im pretty hungry this morning she announced as she slipped into the chair marilla placed for her the world doesnt seem such a howling wilderness as it did last night im so glad its a sunshiny morning but i like rainy mornings real well too all sorts of mornings are interesting dont you think you dont know whats going to happen through the day and theres so much scope for imagination but im glad its not rainy today because its easier to be cheerful and bear up under affliction on a sunshiny day i feel that i have a good deal to bear up under its all very well to read about sorrows and imagine yourself living through them heroically but its not so nice when you really come to have them is it  for pitys sake hold your tongue said marilla you talk entirely too much for a little girl  thereupon anne held her tongue so obediently and thoroughly that her continued silence made marilla rather nervous as if in the presence of something not exactly natural matthew also held his tongue but this was natural so that the meal was a very silent one  as it progressed anne became more and more abstracted eating mechanically with her big eyes fixed unswervingly and unseeingly on the sky outside the window this made marilla more nervous than ever she had an uncomfortable feeling that while this odd childs body might be there at the table her spirit was far away in some remote airy cloudland borne aloft on the wings of imagination who would want such a child about the place  yet matthew wished to keep her of all unaccountable things marilla felt that he wanted it just as much this morning as he had the night before and that he would go on wanting it that was matthews way take a whim into his head and cling to it with the most amazing silent persistency a persistency ten times more potent and effectual in its very silence than if he had talked it out  when the meal was ended anne came out of her reverie and offered to wash the dishes  can you wash dishes right asked marilla distrustfully  pretty well im better at looking after children though ive had so much experience at that its such a pity you havent any here for me to look after  i dont feel as if i wanted any more children to look after than ive got at present youre problem enough in all conscience whats to be done with you i dont know matthew is a most ridiculous man  i think hes lovely said anne reproachfully he is so very sympathetic he didnt mind how much i talked he seemed to like it i felt that he was a kindred spirit as soon as ever i saw him  youre both queer enough if thats what you mean by kindred spirits  said marilla with a sniff yes you may wash the dishes take plenty of hot water and be sure you dry them well ive got enough to attend to this morning for ill have to drive over to white sands in the afternoon and see mrs spencer youll come with me and well settle whats to be done with you after youve finished the dishes go up stairs and make your bed  anne washed the dishes deftly enough as marilla who kept a sharp eye on the process discerned later on she made her bed less successfully for she had never learned the art of wrestling with a feather tick but it was done somehow and smoothed down and then marilla to get rid of her told her she might go out of doors and amuse herself until dinnertime  anne flew to the door face alight eyes glowing on the very threshold she stopped short wheeled about came back and sat down by the table light and glow as effectually blotted out as if some one had clapped an extinguisher on her  whats the matter now demanded marilla  i dont dare go out said anne in the tone of a martyr relinquishing all earthly joys if i cant stay here there is no use in my loving green gables and if i go out there and get acquainted with all those trees and flowers and the orchard and the brook ill not be able to help loving it its hard enough now so i wont make it any harder i want to go out so much everything seems to be calling to me ‘anne anne come out to us anne anne we want a playmate but its better not there is no use in loving things if you have to be torn from them is there and its so hard to keep from loving things isnt it that was why i was so glad when i thought i was going to live here i thought id have so many things to love and nothing to hinder me but that brief dream is over i am resigned to my fate now so i dont think ill go out for fear ill get unresigned again what is the name of that geranium on the window sill please  thats the apple scented geranium  oh i dont mean that sort of a name i mean just a name you gave it yourself didnt you give it a name may i give it one then may i call it let me see bonny would do may i call it bonny while im here oh do let me  goodness i dont care but where on earth is the sense of naming a geranium  oh i like things to have handles even if they are only geraniums it makes them seem more like people how do you know but that it hurts a geraniums feelings just to be called a geranium and nothing else you wouldnt like to be called nothing but a woman all the time yes i shall call it bonny i named that cherry tree outside my bedroom window this morning i called it snow queen because it was so white of course it wont always be in blossom but one can imagine that it is cant one  i never in all my life saw or heard anything to equal her muttered marilla beating a retreat down to the cellar after potatoes she is kind of interesting as matthew says i can feel already that im wondering what on earth shell say next shell be casting a spell over me too shes cast it over matthew that look he gave me when he went out said everything he said or hinted last night over again i wish he was like other men and would talk things out a body could answer back then and argue him into reason but whats to be done with a man who just looks  anne had relapsed into reverie with her chin in her hands and her eyes on the sky when marilla returned from her cellar pilgrimage there marilla left her until the early dinner was on the table  i suppose i can have the mare and buggy this afternoon matthew said marilla  matthew nodded and looked wistfully at anne marilla intercepted the look and said grimly   im going to drive over to white sands and settle this thing ill take anne with me and mrs spencer will probably make arrangements to send her back to nova scotia at once ill set your tea out for you and ill be home in time to milk the cows  still matthew said nothing and marilla had a sense of having wasted words and breath there is nothing more aggravating than a man who wont talk back unless it is a woman who wont  matthew hitched the sorrel into the buggy in due time and marilla and anne set off matthew opened the yard gate for them and as they drove slowly through he said to nobody in particular as it seemed   little jerry buote from the creek was here this morning and i told him i guessed id hire him for the summer  marilla made no reply but she hit the unlucky sorrel such a vicious clip with the whip that the fat mare unused to such treatment whizzed indignantly down the lane at an alarming pace marilla looked back once as the buggy bounced along and saw that aggravating matthew leaning over the gate looking wistfully after them     chapter v annes history   do you know said anne confidentially ive made up my mind to enjoy this drive its been my experience that you can nearly always enjoy things if you make up your mind firmly that you will of course you must make it up firmly i am not going to think about going back to the asylum while were having our drive im just going to think about the drive oh look theres one little early wild rose out isnt it lovely dont you think it must be glad to be a rose wouldnt it be nice if roses could talk im sure they could tell us such lovely things and isnt pink the most bewitching color in the world i love it but i cant wear it redheaded people cant wear pink not even in imagination did you ever know of anybody whose hair was red when she was young but got to be another color when she grew up  no i dont know as i ever did said marilla mercilessly and i shouldnt think it likely to happen in your case either  anne sighed  well that is another hope gone ‘my life is a perfect graveyard of buried hopes thats a sentence i read in a book once and i say it over to comfort myself whenever im disappointed in anything  i dont see where the comforting comes in myself said marilla  why because it sounds so nice and romantic just as if i were a heroine in a book you know i am so fond of romantic things and a graveyard full of buried hopes is about as romantic a thing as one can imagine isnt it im rather glad i have one are we going across the lake of shining waters today  were not going over barrys pond if thats what you mean by your lake of shining waters were going by the shore road  shore road sounds nice said anne dreamily is it as nice as it sounds just when you said ‘shore road i saw it in a picture in my mind as quick as that and white sands is a pretty name too but i dont like it as well as avonlea avonlea is a lovely name it just sounds like music how far is it to white sands  its five miles and as youre evidently bent on talking you might as well talk to some purpose by telling me what you know about yourself  oh what i know about myself isnt really worth telling said anne eagerly if youll only let me tell you what i imagine about myself youll think it ever so much more interesting  no i dont want any of your imaginings just you stick to bald facts begin at the beginning where were you born and how old are you  i was eleven last march said anne resigning herself to bald facts with a little sigh and i was born in bolingbroke nova scotia my fathers name was walter shirley and he was a teacher in the bolingbroke high school my mothers name was bertha shirley arent walter and bertha lovely names im so glad my parents had nice names it would be a real disgrace to have a father named well say jedediah wouldnt it  i guess it doesnt matter what a persons name is as long as he behaves himself said marilla feeling herself called upon to inculcate a good and useful moral  well i dont know anne looked thoughtful i read in a book once that a rose by any other name would smell as sweet but ive never been able to believe it i dont believe a rose would be as nice if it was called a thistle or a skunk cabbage i suppose my father could have been a good man even if he had been called jedediah but im sure it would have been a cross well my mother was a teacher in the high school too but when she married father she gave up teaching of course a husband was enough responsibility mrs thomas said that they were a pair of babies and as poor as church mice they went to live in a weeny teeny little yellow house in bolingbroke ive never seen that house but ive imagined it thousands of times i think it must have had honeysuckle over the parlor window and lilacs in the front yard and lilies of the valley just inside the gate yes and muslin curtains in all the windows muslin curtains give a house such an air i was born in that house mrs thomas said i was the homeliest baby she ever saw i was so scrawny and tiny and nothing but eyes but that mother thought i was perfectly beautiful i should think a mother would be a better judge than a poor woman who came in to scrub wouldnt you im glad she was satisfied with me anyhow i would feel so sad if i thought i was a disappointment to her because she didnt live very long after that you see she died of fever when i was just three months old i do wish shed lived long enough for me to remember calling her mother i think it would be so sweet to say ‘mother dont you and father died four days afterwards from fever too that left me an orphan and folks were at their wits end so mrs thomas said what to do with me you see nobody wanted me even then it seems to be my fate father and mother had both come from places far away and it was well known they hadnt any relatives living finally mrs thomas said shed take me though she was poor and had a drunken husband she brought me up by hand do you know if there is anything in being brought up by hand that ought to make people who are brought up that way better than other people because whenever i was naughty mrs thomas would ask me how i could be such a bad girl when she had brought me up by hand reproachful like  mr and mrs thomas moved away from bolingbroke to marysville and i lived with them until i was eight years old i helped look after the thomas children there were four of them younger than me and i can tell you they took a lot of looking after then mr thomas was killed falling under a train and his mother offered to take mrs thomas and the children but she didnt want me mrs thomas was at her wits end so she said what to do with me then mrs hammond from up the river came down and said shed take me seeing i was handy with children and i went up the river to live with her in a little clearing among the stumps it was a very lonesome place im sure i could never have lived there if i hadnt had an imagination mr hammond worked a little sawmill up there and mrs hammond had eight children she had twins three times i like babies in moderation but twins three times in succession is too much i told mrs hammond so firmly when the last pair came i used to get so dreadfully tired carrying them about  i lived up river with mrs hammond over two years and then mr hammond died and mrs hammond broke up housekeeping she divided her children among her relatives and went to the states i had to go to the asylum at hopeton because nobody would take me they didnt want me at the asylum either they said they were overcrowded as it was but they had to take me and i was there four months until mrs spencer came  anne finished up with another sigh of relief this time evidently she did not like talking about her experiences in a world that had not wanted her  did you ever go to school demanded marilla turning the sorrel mare down the shore road  not a great deal i went a little the last year i stayed with mrs thomas when i went up river we were so far from a school that i couldnt walk it in winter and there was vacation in summer so i could only go in the spring and fall but of course i went while i was at the asylum i can read pretty well and i know ever so many pieces of poetry off by heart ‘the battle of hohenlinden and ‘edinburgh after flodden and ‘bingen on the rhine and lots of the ‘lady of the lake and most of ‘the seasons by james thompson dont you just love poetry that gives you a crinkly feeling up and down your back there is a piece in the fifth reader ‘the downfall of poland that is just full of thrills of course i wasnt in the fifth reader i was only in the fourth but the big girls used to lend me theirs to read  were those women mrs thomas and mrs hammond good to you asked marilla looking at anne out of the corner of her eye  o o o h faltered anne her sensitive little face suddenly flushed scarlet and embarrassment sat on her brow oh they meant to be i know they meant to be just as good and kind as possible and when people mean to be good to you you dont mind very much when theyre not quite always they had a good deal to worry them you know its very trying to have a drunken husband you see and it must be very trying to have twins three times in succession dont you think but i feel sure they meant to be good to me  marilla asked no more questions anne gave herself up to a silent rapture over the shore road and marilla guided the sorrel abstractedly while she pondered deeply pity was suddenly stirring in her heart for the child what a starved unloved life she had had a life of drudgery and poverty and neglect for marilla was shrewd enough to read between the lines of annes history and divine the truth no wonder she had been so delighted at the prospect of a real home it was a pity she had to be sent back what if she marilla should indulge matthews unaccountable whim and let her stay he was set on it and the child seemed a nice teachable little thing  shes got too much to say thought marilla but she might be trained out of that and theres nothing rude or slangy in what she does say shes ladylike its likely her people were nice folks  the shore road was woodsy and wild and lonesome on the right hand scrub firs their spirits quite unbroken by long years of tussle with the gulf winds grew thickly on the left were the steep red sandstone cliffs so near the track in places that a mare of less steadiness than the sorrel might have tried the nerves of the people behind her down at the base of the cliffs were heaps of surf worn rocks or little sandy coves inlaid with pebbles as with ocean jewels beyond lay the sea shimmering and blue and over it soared the gulls their pinions flashing silvery in the sunlight  isnt the sea wonderful said anne rousing from a long wide eyed silence once when i lived in marysville mr thomas hired an express wagon and took us all to spend the day at the shore ten miles away i enjoyed every moment of that day even if i had to look after the children all the time i lived it over in happy dreams for years but this shore is nicer than the marysville shore arent those gulls splendid would you like to be a gull i think i would that is if i couldnt be a human girl dont you think it would be nice to wake up at sunrise and swoop down over the water and away out over that lovely blue all day and then at night to fly back to ones nest oh i can just imagine myself doing it what big house is that just ahead please  thats the white sands hotel mr kirke runs it but the season hasnt begun yet there are heaps of americans come there for the summer they think this shore is just about right  i was afraid it might be mrs spencers place said anne mournfully i dont want to get there somehow it will seem like the end of everything     chapter vi marilla makes up her mind   get there they did however in due season mrs spencer lived in a big yellow house at white sands cove and she came to the door with surprise and welcome mingled on her benevolent face  dear dear she exclaimed youre the last folks i was looking for today but im real glad to see you youll put your horse in and how are you anne  im as well as can be expected thank you said anne smilelessly a blight seemed to have descended on her  i suppose well stay a little while to rest the mare said marilla but i promised matthew id be home early the fact is mrs spencer theres been a queer mistake somewhere and ive come over to see where it is we sent word matthew and i for you to bring us a boy from the asylum we told your brother robert to tell you we wanted a boy ten or eleven years old  marilla cuthbert you dont say so said mrs spencer in distress why robert sent word down by his daughter nancy and she said you wanted a girl didnt she flora jane appealing to her daughter who had come out to the steps  she certainly did miss cuthbert corroborated flora jane earnestly  im dreadful sorry said mrs spencer its too bad but it certainly wasnt my fault you see miss cuthbert i did the best i could and i thought i was following your instructions nancy is a terrible flighty thing ive often had to scold her well for her heedlessness  it was our own fault said marilla resignedly we should have come to you ourselves and not left an important message to be passed along by word of mouth in that fashion anyhow the mistake has been made and the only thing to do now is to set it right can we send the child back to the asylum i suppose theyll take her back wont they  i suppose so said mrs spencer thoughtfully but i dont think it will be necessary to send her back mrs peter blewett was up here yesterday and she was saying to me how much she wished shed sent by me for a little girl to help her mrs peter has a large family you know and she finds it hard to get help anne will be the very girl for her i call it positively providential  marilla did not look as if she thought providence had much to do with the matter here was an unexpectedly good chance to get this unwelcome orphan off her hands and she did not even feel grateful for it  she knew mrs peter blewett only by sight as a small shrewish faced woman without an ounce of superfluous flesh on her bones but she had heard of her a terrible worker and driver mrs peter was said to be and discharged servant girls told fearsome tales of her temper and stinginess and her family of pert quarrelsome children marilla felt a qualm of conscience at the thought of handing anne over to her tender mercies  well ill go in and well talk the matter over she said  and if there isnt mrs peter coming up the lane this blessed minute exclaimed mrs spencer bustling her guests through the hall into the parlor where a deadly chill struck on them as if the air had been strained so long through dark green closely drawn blinds that it had lost every particle of warmth it had ever possessed that is real lucky for we can settle the matter right away take the armchair miss cuthbert anne you sit here on the ottoman and dont wriggle let me take your hats flora jane go out and put the kettle on good afternoon mrs blewett we were just saying how fortunate it was you happened along let me introduce you two ladies mrs blewett miss cuthbert please excuse me for just a moment i forgot to tell flora jane to take the buns out of the oven  mrs spencer whisked away after pulling up the blinds anne sitting mutely on the ottoman with her hands clasped tightly in her lap stared at mrs blewett as one fascinated was she to be given into the keeping of this sharp faced sharp eyed woman she felt a lump coming up in her throat and her eyes smarted painfully she was beginning to be afraid she couldnt keep the tears back when mrs spencer returned flushed and beaming quite capable of taking any and every difficulty physical mental or spiritual into consideration and settling it out of hand  it seems theres been a mistake about this little girl mrs blewett  she said i was under the impression that mr and miss cuthbert wanted a little girl to adopt i was certainly told so but it seems it was a boy they wanted so if youre still of the same mind you were yesterday i think shell be just the thing for you  mrs blewett darted her eyes over anne from head to foot  how old are you and whats your name she demanded  anne shirley faltered the shrinking child not daring to make any stipulations regarding the spelling thereof and im eleven years old  humph you dont look as if there was much to you but youre wiry i dont know but the wiry ones are the best after all well if i take you youll have to be a good girl you know good and smart and respectful ill expect you to earn your keep and no mistake about that yes i suppose i might as well take her off your hands miss cuthbert the babys awful fractious and im clean worn out attending to him if you like i can take her right home now  marilla looked at anne and softened at sight of the childs pale face with its look of mute misery the misery of a helpless little creature who finds itself once more caught in the trap from which it had escaped marilla felt an uncomfortable conviction that if she denied the appeal of that look it would haunt her to her dying day moreover she did not fancy mrs blewett to hand a sensitive highstrung child over to such a woman no she could not take the responsibility of doing that  well i dont know she said slowly i didnt say that matthew and i had absolutely decided that we wouldnt keep her in fact i may say that matthew is disposed to keep her i just came over to find out how the mistake had occurred i think id better take her home again and talk it over with matthew i feel that i oughtnt to decide on anything without consulting him if we make up our mind not to keep her well bring or send her over to you tomorrow night if we dont you may know that she is going to stay with us will that suit you mrs blewett  i suppose itll have to said mrs blewett ungraciously  during marillas speech a sunrise had been dawning on annes face first the look of despair faded out then came a faint flush of hope her eyes grew deep and bright as morning stars the child was quite transfigured and a moment later when mrs spencer and mrs blewett went out in quest of a recipe the latter had come to borrow she sprang up and flew across the room to marilla  oh miss cuthbert did you really say that perhaps you would let me stay at green gables she said in a breathless whisper as if speaking aloud might shatter the glorious possibility did you really say it or did i only imagine that you did  i think youd better learn to control that imagination of yours anne if you cant distinguish between what is real and what isnt said marilla crossly yes you did hear me say just that and no more it isnt decided yet and perhaps we will conclude to let mrs blewett take you after all she certainly needs you much more than i do  id rather go back to the asylum than go to live with her said anne passionately she looks exactly like a like a gimlet  marilla smothered a smile under the conviction that anne must be reproved for such a speech  a little girl like you should be ashamed of talking so about a lady and a stranger she said severely go back and sit down quietly and hold your tongue and behave as a good girl should  ill try to do and be anything you want me if youll only keep me  said anne returning meekly to her ottoman  when they arrived back at green gables that evening matthew met them in the lane marilla from afar had noted him prowling along it and guessed his motive she was prepared for the relief she read in his face when he saw that she had at least brought anne back with her but she said nothing to him relative to the affair until they were both out in the yard behind the barn milking the cows then she briefly told him annes history and the result of the interview with mrs spencer  i wouldnt give a dog i liked to that blewett woman said matthew with unusual vim  i dont fancy her style myself admitted marilla but its that or keeping her ourselves matthew and since you seem to want her i suppose im willing or have to be ive been thinking over the idea until ive got kind of used to it it seems a sort of duty ive never brought up a child especially a girl and i dare say ill make a terrible mess of it but ill do my best so far as im concerned matthew she may stay  matthews shy face was a glow of delight  well now i reckoned youd come to see it in that light marilla he said shes such an interesting little thing  itd be more to the point if you could say she was a useful little thing retorted marilla but ill make it my business to see shes trained to be that and mind matthew youre not to go interfering with my methods perhaps an old maid doesnt know much about bringing up a child but i guess she knows more than an old bachelor so you just leave me to manage her when i fail itll be time enough to put your oar in  there there marilla you can have your own way said matthew reassuringly only be as good and kind to her as you can without spoiling her i kind of think shes one of the sort you can do anything with if you only get her to love you  marilla sniffed to express her contempt for matthews opinions concerning anything feminine and walked off to the dairy with the pails  i wont tell her tonight that she can stay she reflected as she strained the milk into the creamers shed be so excited that she wouldnt sleep a wink marilla cuthbert youre fairly in for it did you ever suppose youd see the day when youd be adopting an orphan girl its surprising enough but not so surprising as that matthew should be at the bottom of it him that always seemed to have such a mortal dread of little girls anyhow weve decided on the experiment and goodness only knows what will come of it     chapter vii anne says her prayers   when marilla took anne up to bed that night she said stiffly   now anne i noticed last night that you threw your clothes all about the floor when you took them off that is a very untidy habit and i cant allow it at all as soon as you take off any article of clothing fold it neatly and place it on the chair i havent any use at all for little girls who arent neat  i was so harrowed up in my mind last night that i didnt think about my clothes at all said anne ill fold them nicely tonight they always made us do that at the asylum half the time though id forget id be in such a hurry to get into bed nice and quiet and imagine things  youll have to remember a little better if you stay here admonished marilla there that looks something like say your prayers now and get into bed  i never say any prayers announced anne  marilla looked horrified astonishment  why anne what do you mean were you never taught to say your prayers god always wants little girls to say their prayers dont you know who god is anne  ‘god is a spirit infinite eternal and unchangeable in his being wisdom power holiness justice goodness and truth responded anne promptly and glibly  marilla looked rather relieved  so you do know something then thank goodness youre not quite a heathen where did you learn that  oh at the asylum sunday school they made us learn the whole catechism i liked it pretty well theres something splendid about some of the words ‘infinite eternal and unchangeable isnt that grand it has such a roll to it just like a big organ playing you couldnt quite call it poetry i suppose but it sounds a lot like it doesnt it  were not talking about poetry anne we are talking about saying your prayers dont you know its a terrible wicked thing not to say your prayers every night im afraid you are a very bad little girl  youd find it easier to be bad than good if you had red hair said anne reproachfully people who havent red hair dont know what trouble is mrs thomas told me that god made my hair red on purpose and ive never cared about him since and anyhow id always be too tired at night to bother saying prayers people who have to look after twins cant be expected to say their prayers now do you honestly think they can  marilla decided that annes religious training must be begun at once plainly there was no time to be lost  you must say your prayers while you are under my roof anne  why of course if you want me to assented anne cheerfully id do anything to oblige you but youll have to tell me what to say for this once after i get into bed ill imagine out a real nice prayer to say always i believe that it will be quite interesting now that i come to think of it  you must kneel down said marilla in embarrassment  anne knelt at marillas knee and looked up gravely  why must people kneel down to pray if i really wanted to pray ill tell you what id do id go out into a great big field all alone or into the deep deep woods and id look up into the sky up up up into that lovely blue sky that looks as if there was no end to its blueness and then id just feel a prayer well im ready what am i to say  marilla felt more embarrassed than ever she had intended to teach anne the childish classic now i lay me down to sleep but she had as i have told you the glimmerings of a sense of humor which is simply another name for a sense of the fitness of things and it suddenly occurred to her that that simple little prayer sacred to white robed childhood lisping at motherly knees was entirely unsuited to this freckled witch of a girl who knew and cared nothing about gods love since she had never had it translated to her through the medium of human love  youre old enough to pray for yourself anne she said finally just thank god for your blessings and ask him humbly for the things you want  well ill do my best promised anne burying her face in marillas lap gracious heavenly father thats the way the ministers say it in church so i suppose its all right in private prayer isnt it she interjected lifting her head for a moment gracious heavenly father i thank thee for the white way of delight and the lake of shining waters and bonny and the snow queen im really extremely grateful for them and thats all the blessings i can think of just now to thank thee for as for the things i want theyre so numerous that it would take a great deal of time to name them all so i will only mention the two most important please let me stay at green gables and please let me be good looking when i grow up i remain                      yours respectfully                        anne shirley  there did i do all right she asked eagerly getting up i could have made it much more flowery if id had a little more time to think it over  poor marilla was only preserved from complete collapse by remembering that it was not irreverence but simply spiritual ignorance on the part of anne that was responsible for this extraordinary petition she tucked the child up in bed mentally vowing that she should be taught a prayer the very next day and was leaving the room with the light when anne called her back  ive just thought of it now i should have said ‘amen in place of ‘yours respectfully shouldnt i the way the ministers do id forgotten it but i felt a prayer should be finished off in some way so i put in the other do you suppose it will make any difference  i i dont suppose it will said marilla go to sleep now like a good child good night  i can say good night tonight with a clear conscience said anne cuddling luxuriously down among her pillows  marilla retreated to the kitchen set the candle firmly on the table and glared at matthew  matthew cuthbert its about time somebody adopted that child and taught her something shes next door to a perfect heathen will you believe that she never said a prayer in her life till tonight ill send to the manse tomorrow and borrow the peep of the day series thats what ill do and she shall go to sunday school just as soon as i can get some suitable clothes made for her i foresee that i shall have my hands full well well we cant get through this world without our share of trouble ive had a pretty easy life of it so far but my time has come at last and i suppose ill just have to make the best of it     chapter viii annes bringing up is begun   for reasons best known to herself marilla did not tell anne that she was to stay at green gables until the next afternoon during the forenoon she kept the child busy with various tasks and watched over her with a keen eye while she did them by noon she had concluded that anne was smart and obedient willing to work and quick to learn her most serious shortcoming seemed to be a tendency to fall into daydreams in the middle of a task and forget all about it until such time as she was sharply recalled to earth by a reprimand or a catastrophe  when anne had finished washing the dinner dishes she suddenly confronted marilla with the air and expression of one desperately determined to learn the worst her thin little body trembled from head to foot her face flushed and her eyes dilated until they were almost black she clasped her hands tightly and said in an imploring voice   oh please miss cuthbert wont you tell me if you are going to send me away or not ive tried to be patient all the morning but i really feel that i cannot bear not knowing any longer its a dreadful feeling please tell me  you havent scalded the dishcloth in clean hot water as i told you to do said marilla immovably just go and do it before you ask any more questions anne  anne went and attended to the dishcloth then she returned to marilla and fastened imploring eyes on the latters face  well said marilla unable to find any excuse for deferring her explanation longer i suppose i might as well tell you matthew and i have decided to keep you that is if you will try to be a good little girl and show yourself grateful why child whatever is the matter  im crying said anne in a tone of bewilderment i cant think why im glad as glad can be oh glad doesnt seem the right word at all i was glad about the white way and the cherry blossoms but this oh its something more than glad im so happy ill try to be so good it will be uphill work i expect for mrs thomas often told me i was desperately wicked however ill do my very best but can you tell me why im crying  i suppose its because youre all excited and worked up said marilla disapprovingly sit down on that chair and try to calm yourself im afraid you both cry and laugh far too easily yes you can stay here and we will try to do right by you you must go to school but its only a fortnight till vacation so it isnt worth while for you to start before it opens again in september  what am i to call you asked anne shall i always say miss cuthbert can i call you aunt marilla  no youll call me just plain marilla im not used to being called miss cuthbert and it would make me nervous  it sounds awfully disrespectful to just say marilla protested anne  i guess therell be nothing disrespectful in it if youre careful to speak respectfully everybody young and old in avonlea calls me marilla except the minister he says miss cuthbert when he thinks of it  id love to call you aunt marilla said anne wistfully ive never had an aunt or any relation at all not even a grandmother it would make me feel as if i really belonged to you cant i call you aunt marilla  no im not your aunt and i dont believe in calling people names that dont belong to them  but we could imagine you were my aunt  i couldnt said marilla grimly  do you never imagine things different from what they really are asked anne wide eyed  no  oh anne drew a long breath oh miss marilla how much you miss  i dont believe in imagining things different from what they really are retorted marilla when the lord puts us in certain circumstances he doesnt mean for us to imagine them away and that reminds me go into the sitting room anne be sure your feet are clean and dont let any flies in and bring me out the illustrated card thats on the mantelpiece the lords prayer is on it and youll devote your spare time this afternoon to learning it off by heart theres to be no more of such praying as i heard last night  i suppose i was very awkward said anne apologetically but then you see id never had any practice you couldnt really expect a person to pray very well the first time she tried could you i thought out a splendid prayer after i went to bed just as i promised you i would it was nearly as long as a ministers and so poetical but would you believe it i couldnt remember one word when i woke up this morning and im afraid ill never be able to think out another one as good somehow things never are so good when theyre thought out a second time have you ever noticed that  here is something for you to notice anne when i tell you to do a thing i want you to obey me at once and not stand stock still and discourse about it just you go and do as i bid you  anne promptly departed for the sitting room across the hall she failed to return after waiting ten minutes marilla laid down her knitting and marched after her with a grim expression she found anne standing motionless before a picture hanging on the wall between the two windows with her eyes astar with dreams the white and green light strained through apple trees and clustering vines outside fell over the rapt little figure with a half unearthly radiance  anne whatever are you thinking of demanded marilla sharply  anne came back to earth with a start  that she said pointing to the picture a rather vivid chromo entitled christ blessing little children and i was just imagining i was one of them that i was the little girl in the blue dress standing off by herself in the corner as if she didnt belong to anybody like me she looks lonely and sad dont you think i guess she hadnt any father or mother of her own but she wanted to be blessed too so she just crept shyly up on the outside of the crowd hoping nobody would notice her except him im sure i know just how she felt her heart must have beat and her hands must have got cold like mine did when i asked you if i could stay she was afraid he mightnt notice her but its likely he did dont you think ive been trying to imagine it all out her edging a little nearer all the time until she was quite close to him and then he would look at her and put his hand on her hair and oh such a thrill of joy as would run over her but i wish the artist hadnt painted him so sorrowful looking all his pictures are like that if youve noticed but i dont believe he could really have looked so sad or the children would have been afraid of him  anne said marilla wondering why she had not broken into this speech long before you shouldnt talk that way its irreverent positively irreverent  annes eyes marveled  why i felt just as reverent as could be im sure i didnt mean to be irreverent  well i dont suppose you did but it doesnt sound right to talk so familiarly about such things and another thing anne when i send you after something youre to bring it at once and not fall into mooning and imagining before pictures remember that take that card and come right to the kitchen now sit down in the corner and learn that prayer off by heart  anne set the card up against the jugful of apple blossoms she had brought in to decorate the dinner table marilla had eyed that decoration askance but had said nothing propped her chin on her hands and fell to studying it intently for several silent minutes  i like this she announced at length its beautiful ive heard it before i heard the superintendent of the asylum sunday school say it over once but i didnt like it then he had such a cracked voice and he prayed it so mournfully i really felt sure he thought praying was a disagreeable duty this isnt poetry but it makes me feel just the same way poetry does ‘our father who art in heaven hallowed be thy name that is just like a line of music oh im so glad you thought of making me learn this miss marilla  well learn it and hold your tongue said marilla shortly  anne tipped the vase of apple blossoms near enough to bestow a soft kiss on a pink cupped bud and then studied diligently for some moments longer  marilla she demanded presently do you think that i shall ever have a bosom friend in avonlea  a a what kind of friend  a bosom friend an intimate friend you know a really kindred spirit to whom i can confide my inmost soul ive dreamed of meeting her all my life i never really supposed i would but so many of my loveliest dreams have come true all at once that perhaps this one will too do you think its possible  diana barry lives over at orchard slope and shes about your age shes a very nice little girl and perhaps she will be a playmate for you when she comes home shes visiting her aunt over at carmody just now youll have to be careful how you behave yourself though mrs barry is a very particular woman she wont let diana play with any little girl who isnt nice and good  anne looked at marilla through the apple blossoms her eyes aglow with interest  what is diana like her hair isnt red is it oh i hope not its bad enough to have red hair myself but i positively couldnt endure it in a bosom friend  diana is a very pretty little girl she has black eyes and hair and rosy cheeks and she is good and smart which is better than being pretty  marilla was as fond of morals as the duchess in wonderland and was firmly convinced that one should be tacked on to every remark made to a child who was being brought up  but anne waved the moral inconsequently aside and seized only on the delightful possibilities before it  oh im so glad shes pretty next to being beautiful oneself and thats impossible in my case it would be best to have a beautiful bosom friend when i lived with mrs thomas she had a bookcase in her sitting room with glass doors there werent any books in it mrs thomas kept her best china and her preserves there when she had any preserves to keep one of the doors was broken mr thomas smashed it one night when he was slightly intoxicated but the other was whole and i used to pretend that my reflection in it was another little girl who lived in it i called her katie maurice and we were very intimate i used to talk to her by the hour especially on sunday and tell her everything katie was the comfort and consolation of my life we used to pretend that the bookcase was enchanted and that if i only knew the spell i could open the door and step right into the room where katie maurice lived instead of into mrs thomas shelves of preserves and china and then katie maurice would have taken me by the hand and led me out into a wonderful place all flowers and sunshine and fairies and we would have lived there happy for ever after when i went to live with mrs hammond it just broke my heart to leave katie maurice she felt it dreadfully too i know she did for she was crying when she kissed me good bye through the bookcase door there was no bookcase at mrs hammonds but just up the river a little way from the house there was a long green little valley and the loveliest echo lived there it echoed back every word you said even if you didnt talk a bit loud so i imagined that it was a little girl called violetta and we were great friends and i loved her almost as well as i loved katie maurice not quite but almost you know the night before i went to the asylum i said good bye to violetta and oh her good bye came back to me in such sad sad tones i had become so attached to her that i hadnt the heart to imagine a bosom friend at the asylum even if there had been any scope for imagination there  i think its just as well there wasnt said marilla drily i dont approve of such goings on you seem to half believe your own imaginations it will be well for you to have a real live friend to put such nonsense out of your head but dont let mrs barry hear you talking about your katie maurices and your violettas or shell think you tell stories  oh i wont i couldnt talk of them to everybody their memories are too sacred for that but i thought id like to have you know about them oh look heres a big bee just tumbled out of an apple blossom just think what a lovely place to live in an apple blossom fancy going to sleep in it when the wind was rocking it if i wasnt a human girl i think id like to be a bee and live among the flowers  yesterday you wanted to be a sea gull sniffed marilla i think you are very fickle minded i told you to learn that prayer and not talk but it seems impossible for you to stop talking if youve got anybody that will listen to you so go up to your room and learn it  oh i know it pretty nearly all now all but just the last line  well never mind do as i tell you go to your room and finish learning it well and stay there until i call you down to help me get tea  can i take the apple blossoms with me for company pleaded anne  no you dont want your room cluttered up with flowers you should have left them on the tree in the first place  i did feel a little that way too said anne i kind of felt i shouldnt shorten their lovely lives by picking them i wouldnt want to be picked if i were an apple blossom but the temptation was irresistible what do you do when you meet with an irresistible temptation  anne did you hear me tell you to go to your room  anne sighed retreated to the east gable and sat down in a chair by the window  there i know this prayer i learned that last sentence coming upstairs now im going to imagine things into this room so that theyll always stay imagined the floor is covered with a white velvet carpet with pink roses all over it and there are pink silk curtains at the windows the walls are hung with gold and silver brocade tapestry the furniture is mahogany i never saw any mahogany but it does sound so luxurious this is a couch all heaped with gorgeous silken cushions pink and blue and crimson and gold and i am reclining gracefully on it i can see my reflection in that splendid big mirror hanging on the wall i am tall and regal clad in a gown of trailing white lace with a pearl cross on my breast and pearls in my hair my hair is of midnight darkness and my skin is a clear ivory pallor my name is the lady cordelia fitzgerald no it isnt i cant make that seem real  she danced up to the little looking glass and peered into it her pointed freckled face and solemn gray eyes peered back at her  youre only anne of green gables she said earnestly and i see you just as you are looking now whenever i try to imagine im the lady cordelia but its a million times nicer to be anne of green gables than anne of nowhere in particular isnt it  she bent forward kissed her reflection affectionately and betook herself to the open window   dear snow queen good afternoon and good afternoon dear birches down in the hollow and good afternoon dear gray house up on the hill i wonder if diana is to be my bosom friend i hope she will and i shall love her very much but i must never quite forget katie maurice and violetta they would feel so hurt if i did and id hate to hurt anybodys feelings even a little bookcase girls or a little echo girls i must be careful to remember them and send them a kiss every day  anne blew a couple of airy kisses from her fingertips past the cherry blossoms and then with her chin in her hands drifted luxuriously out on a sea of daydreams     chapter ix mrs rachel lynde is properly horrified   anne had been a fortnight at green gables before mrs lynde arrived to inspect her mrs rachel to do her justice was not to blame for this a severe and unseasonable attack of grippe had confined that good lady to her house ever since the occasion of her last visit to green gables mrs rachel was not often sick and had a well defined contempt for people who were but grippe she asserted was like no other illness on earth and could only be interpreted as one of the special visitations of providence as soon as her doctor allowed her to put her foot out of doors she hurried up to green gables bursting with curiosity to see matthew and marillas orphan concerning whom all sorts of stories and suppositions had gone abroad in avonlea  anne had made good use of every waking moment of that fortnight already she was acquainted with every tree and shrub about the place she had discovered that a lane opened out below the apple orchard and ran up through a belt of woodland and she had explored it to its furthest end in all its delicious vagaries of brook and bridge fir coppice and wild cherry arch corners thick with fern and branching byways of maple and mountain ash  she had made friends with the spring down in the hollow that wonderful deep clear icy cold spring it was set about with smooth red sandstones and rimmed in by great palm like clumps of water fern and beyond it was a log bridge over the brook  that bridge led annes dancing feet up over a wooded hill beyond where perpetual twilight reigned under the straight thick growing firs and spruces the only flowers there were myriads of delicate june bells  those shyest and sweetest of woodland blooms and a few pale aerial starflowers like the spirits of last years blossoms gossamers glimmered like threads of silver among the trees and the fir boughs and tassels seemed to utter friendly speech  all these raptured voyages of exploration were made in the odd half hours which she was allowed for play and anne talked matthew and marilla half deaf over her discoveries not that matthew complained to be sure he listened to it all with a wordless smile of enjoyment on his face marilla permitted the chatter until she found herself becoming too interested in it whereupon she always promptly quenched anne by a curt command to hold her tongue  anne was out in the orchard when mrs rachel came wandering at her own sweet will through the lush tremulous grasses splashed with ruddy evening sunshine so that good lady had an excellent chance to talk her illness fully over describing every ache and pulse beat with such evident enjoyment that marilla thought even grippe must bring its compensations when details were exhausted mrs rachel introduced the real reason of her call  ive been hearing some surprising things about you and matthew  i dont suppose you are any more surprised than i am myself said marilla im getting over my surprise now  it was too bad there was such a mistake said mrs rachel sympathetically couldnt you have sent her back  i suppose we could but we decided not to matthew took a fancy to her and i must say i like her myself although i admit she has her faults the house seems a different place already shes a real bright little thing  marilla said more than she had intended to say when she began for she read disapproval in mrs rachels expression  its a great responsibility youve taken on yourself said that lady gloomily especially when youve never had any experience with children you dont know much about her or her real disposition i suppose and theres no guessing how a child like that will turn out but i dont want to discourage you im sure marilla  im not feeling discouraged was marillas dry response when i make up my mind to do a thing it stays made up i suppose youd like to see anne ill call her in  anne came running in presently her face sparkling with the delight of her orchard rovings but abashed at finding the delight herself in the unexpected presence of a stranger she halted confusedly inside the door she certainly was an odd looking little creature in the short tight wincey dress she had worn from the asylum below which her thin legs seemed ungracefully long her freckles were more numerous and obtrusive than ever the wind had ruffled her hatless hair into over brilliant disorder it had never looked redder than at that moment  well they didnt pick you for your looks thats sure and certain  was mrs rachel lyndes emphatic comment mrs rachel was one of those delightful and popular people who pride themselves on speaking their mind without fear or favor shes terrible skinny and homely marilla come here child and let me have a look at you lawful heart did any one ever see such freckles and hair as red as carrots come here child i say  anne came there but not exactly as mrs rachel expected with one bound she crossed the kitchen floor and stood before mrs rachel her face scarlet with anger her lips quivering and her whole slender form trembling from head to foot  i hate you she cried in a choked voice stamping her foot on the floor i hate you i hate you i hate you  a louder stamp with each assertion of hatred how dare you call me skinny and ugly how dare you say im freckled and redheaded you are a rude impolite unfeeling woman  anne exclaimed marilla in consternation  but anne continued to face mrs rachel undauntedly head up eyes blazing hands clenched passionate indignation exhaling from her like an atmosphere  how dare you say such things about me she repeated vehemently how would you like to have such things said about you how would you like to be told that you are fat and clumsy and probably hadnt a spark of imagination in you i dont care if i do hurt your feelings by saying so i hope i hurt them you have hurt mine worse than they were ever hurt before even by mrs thomas intoxicated husband and ill never forgive you for it never never  stamp stamp  did anybody ever see such a temper exclaimed the horrified mrs rachel  anne go to your room and stay there until i come up said marilla recovering her powers of speech with difficulty  anne bursting into tears rushed to the hall door slammed it until the tins on the porch wall outside rattled in sympathy and fled through the hall and up the stairs like a whirlwind a subdued slam above told that the door of the east gable had been shut with equal vehemence  well i dont envy you your job bringing that up marilla said mrs rachel with unspeakable solemnity  marilla opened her lips to say she knew not what of apology or deprecation what she did say was a surprise to herself then and ever afterwards  you shouldnt have twitted her about her looks rachel  marilla cuthbert you dont mean to say that you are upholding her in such a terrible display of temper as weve just seen demanded mrs rachel indignantly  no said marilla slowly im not trying to excuse her shes been very naughty and ill have to give her a talking to about it but we must make allowances for her shes never been taught what is right and you were too hard on her rachel  marilla could not help tacking on that last sentence although she was again surprised at herself for doing it mrs rachel got up with an air of offended dignity  well i see that ill have to be very careful what i say after this marilla since the fine feelings of orphans brought from goodness knows where have to be considered before anything else oh no im not vexed dont worry yourself im too sorry for you to leave any room for anger in my mind youll have your own troubles with that child but if youll take my advice which i suppose you wont do although ive brought up ten children and buried two youll do that ‘talking to you mention with a fair sized birch switch i should think that would be the most effective language for that kind of a child her temper matches her hair i guess well good evening marilla i hope youll come down to see me often as usual but you cant expect me to visit here again in a hurry if im liable to be flown at and insulted in such a fashion its something new in my experience  whereat mrs rachel swept out and away if a fat woman who always waddled could be said to sweep away and marilla with a very solemn face betook herself to the east gable  on the way upstairs she pondered uneasily as to what she ought to do she felt no little dismay over the scene that had just been enacted how unfortunate that anne should have displayed such temper before mrs rachel lynde of all people then marilla suddenly became aware of an uncomfortable and rebuking consciousness that she felt more humiliation over this than sorrow over the discovery of such a serious defect in annes disposition and how was she to punish her the amiable suggestion of the birch switch to the efficiency of which all of mrs rachels own children could have borne smarting testimony did not appeal to marilla she did not believe she could whip a child no some other method of punishment must be found to bring anne to a proper realization of the enormity of her offense  marilla found anne face downward on her bed crying bitterly quite oblivious of muddy boots on a clean counterpane  anne she said not ungently  no answer  anne with greater severity get off that bed this minute and listen to what i have to say to you  anne squirmed off the bed and sat rigidly on a chair beside it her face swollen and tear stained and her eyes fixed stubbornly on the floor  this is a nice way for you to behave anne arent you ashamed of yourself  she hadnt any right to call me ugly and redheaded retorted anne evasive and defiant  you hadnt any right to fly into such a fury and talk the way you did to her anne i was ashamed of you thoroughly ashamed of you i wanted you to behave nicely to mrs lynde and instead of that you have disgraced me im sure i dont know why you should lose your temper like that just because mrs lynde said you were red haired and homely you say it yourself often enough  oh but theres such a difference between saying a thing yourself and hearing other people say it wailed anne you may know a thing is so but you cant help hoping other people dont quite think it is i suppose you think i have an awful temper but i couldnt help it when she said those things something just rose right up in me and choked me i had to fly out at her  well you made a fine exhibition of yourself i must say mrs lynde will have a nice story to tell about you everywhere and shell tell it too it was a dreadful thing for you to lose your temper like that anne  just imagine how you would feel if somebody told you to your face that you were skinny and ugly pleaded anne tearfully  an old remembrance suddenly rose up before marilla she had been a very small child when she had heard one aunt say of her to another what a pity she is such a dark homely little thing marilla was every day of fifty before the sting had gone out of that memory  i dont say that i think mrs lynde was exactly right in saying what she did to you anne she admitted in a softer tone rachel is too outspoken but that is no excuse for such behavior on your part she was a stranger and an elderly person and my visitor all three very good reasons why you should have been respectful to her you were rude and saucy and marilla had a saving inspiration of punishment you must go to her and tell her you are very sorry for your bad temper and ask her to forgive you  i can never do that said anne determinedly and darkly you can punish me in any way you like marilla you can shut me up in a dark damp dungeon inhabited by snakes and toads and feed me only on bread and water and i shall not complain but i cannot ask mrs lynde to forgive me  were not in the habit of shutting people up in dark damp dungeons  said marilla drily especially as theyre rather scarce in avonlea but apologize to mrs lynde you must and shall and youll stay here in your room until you can tell me youre willing to do it  i shall have to stay here forever then said anne mournfully because i cant tell mrs lynde im sorry i said those things to her how can i im not sorry im sorry ive vexed you but im glad i told her just what i did it was a great satisfaction i cant say im sorry when im not can i i cant even imagine im sorry  perhaps your imagination will be in better working order by the morning said marilla rising to depart youll have the night to think over your conduct in and come to a better frame of mind you said you would try to be a very good girl if we kept you at green gables but i must say it hasnt seemed very much like it this evening  leaving this parthian shaft to rankle in annes stormy bosom marilla descended to the kitchen grievously troubled in mind and vexed in soul she was as angry with herself as with anne because whenever she recalled mrs rachels dumbfounded countenance her lips twitched with amusement and she felt a most reprehensible desire to laugh     chapter x annes apology   marilla said nothing to matthew about the affair that evening but when anne proved still refractory the next morning an explanation had to be made to account for her absence from the breakfast table marilla told matthew the whole story taking pains to impress him with a due sense of the enormity of annes behavior  its a good thing rachel lynde got a calling down shes a meddlesome old gossip was matthews consolatory rejoinder  matthew cuthbert im astonished at you you know that annes behavior was dreadful and yet you take her part i suppose youll be saying next thing that she oughtnt to be punished at all  well now no not exactly said matthew uneasily i reckon she ought to be punished a little but dont be too hard on her marilla recollect she hasnt ever had anyone to teach her right youre youre going to give her something to eat arent you  when did you ever hear of me starving people into good behavior  demanded marilla indignantly shell have her meals regular and ill carry them up to her myself but shell stay up there until shes willing to apologize to mrs lynde and thats final matthew  breakfast dinner and supper were very silent meals for anne still remained obdurate after each meal marilla carried a well filled tray to the east gable and brought it down later on not noticeably depleted matthew eyed its last descent with a troubled eye had anne eaten anything at all  when marilla went out that evening to bring the cows from the back pasture matthew who had been hanging about the barns and watching slipped into the house with the air of a burglar and crept upstairs as a general thing matthew gravitated between the kitchen and the little bedroom off the hall where he slept once in a while he ventured uncomfortably into the parlor or sitting room when the minister came to tea but he had never been upstairs in his own house since the spring he helped marilla paper the spare bedroom and that was four years ago  he tiptoed along the hall and stood for several minutes outside the door of the east gable before he summoned courage to tap on it with his fingers and then open the door to peep in  anne was sitting on the yellow chair by the window gazing mournfully out into the garden very small and unhappy she looked and matthews heart smote him he softly closed the door and tiptoed over to her  anne he whispered as if afraid of being overheard how are you making it anne  anne smiled wanly  pretty well i imagine a good deal and that helps to pass the time of course its rather lonesome but then i may as well get used to that  anne smiled again bravely facing the long years of solitary imprisonment before her  matthew recollected that he must say what he had come to say without loss of time lest marilla return prematurely well now anne dont you think youd better do it and have it over with he whispered itll have to be done sooner or later you know for marillas a dreadful determined woman dreadful determined anne do it right off i say and have it over  do you mean apologize to mrs lynde  yes apologize thats the very word said matthew eagerly just smooth it over so to speak thats what i was trying to get at  i suppose i could do it to oblige you said anne thoughtfully it would be true enough to say i am sorry because i am sorry now i wasnt a bit sorry last night i was mad clear through and i stayed mad all night i know i did because i woke up three times and i was just furious every time but this morning it was over i wasnt in a temper anymore and it left a dreadful sort of goneness too i felt so ashamed of myself but i just couldnt think of going and telling mrs lynde so it would be so humiliating i made up my mind id stay shut up here forever rather than do that but still id do anything for you if you really want me to   well now of course i do its terrible lonesome downstairs without you just go and smooth things over thats a good girl  very well said anne resignedly ill tell marilla as soon as she comes in ive repented  thats right thats right anne but dont tell marilla i said anything about it she might think i was putting my oar in and i promised not to do that  wild horses wont drag the secret from me promised anne solemnly how would wild horses drag a secret from a person anyhow  but matthew was gone scared at his own success he fled hastily to the remotest corner of the horse pasture lest marilla should suspect what he had been up to marilla herself upon her return to the house was agreeably surprised to hear a plaintive voice calling marilla over the banisters  well she said going into the hall  im sorry i lost my temper and said rude things and im willing to go and tell mrs lynde so  very well marillas crispness gave no sign of her relief she had been wondering what under the canopy she should do if anne did not give in ill take you down after milking  accordingly after milking behold marilla and anne walking down the lane the former erect and triumphant the latter drooping and dejected but halfway down annes dejection vanished as if by enchantment she lifted her head and stepped lightly along her eyes fixed on the sunset sky and an air of subdued exhilaration about her marilla beheld the change disapprovingly this was no meek penitent such as it behooved her to take into the presence of the offended mrs lynde  what are you thinking of anne she asked sharply  im imagining out what i must say to mrs lynde answered anne dreamily  this was satisfactory or should have been so but marilla could not rid herself of the notion that something in her scheme of punishment was going askew anne had no business to look so rapt and radiant  rapt and radiant anne continued until they were in the very presence of mrs lynde who was sitting knitting by her kitchen window then the radiance vanished mournful penitence appeared on every feature before a word was spoken anne suddenly went down on her knees before the astonished mrs rachel and held out her hands beseechingly  oh mrs lynde i am so extremely sorry she said with a quiver in her voice i could never express all my sorrow no not if i used up a whole dictionary you must just imagine it i behaved terribly to you and ive disgraced the dear friends matthew and marilla who have let me stay at green gables although im not a boy im a dreadfully wicked and ungrateful girl and i deserve to be punished and cast out by respectable people forever it was very wicked of me to fly into a temper because you told me the truth it was the truth every word you said was true my hair is red and im freckled and skinny and ugly what i said to you was true too but i shouldnt have said it oh mrs lynde please please forgive me if you refuse it will be a lifelong sorrow on a poor little orphan girl would you even if she had a dreadful temper oh i am sure you wouldnt please say you forgive me mrs lynde  anne clasped her hands together bowed her head and waited for the word of judgment  there was no mistaking her sincerity it breathed in every tone of her voice both marilla and mrs lynde recognized its unmistakable ring but the former understood in dismay that anne was actually enjoying her valley of humiliation was reveling in the thoroughness of her abasement where was the wholesome punishment upon which she marilla had plumed herself anne had turned it into a species of positive pleasure  good mrs lynde not being overburdened with perception did not see this she only perceived that anne had made a very thorough apology and all resentment vanished from her kindly if somewhat officious heart  there there get up child she said heartily of course i forgive you i guess i was a little too hard on you anyway but im such an outspoken person you just mustnt mind me thats what it cant be denied your hair is terrible red but i knew a girl once went to school with her in fact whose hair was every mite as red as yours when she was young but when she grew up it darkened to a real handsome auburn i wouldnt be a mite surprised if yours did too not a mite  oh mrs lynde anne drew a long breath as she rose to her feet you have given me a hope i shall always feel that you are a benefactor oh i could endure anything if i only thought my hair would be a handsome auburn when i grew up it would be so much easier to be good if ones hair was a handsome auburn dont you think and now may i go out into your garden and sit on that bench under the apple trees while you and marilla are talking there is so much more scope for imagination out there  laws yes run along child and you can pick a bouquet of them white june lilies over in the corner if you like  as the door closed behind anne mrs lynde got briskly up to light a lamp  shes a real odd little thing take this chair marilla its easier than the one youve got i just keep that for the hired boy to sit on yes she certainly is an odd child but there is something kind of taking about her after all i dont feel so surprised at you and matthew keeping her as i did nor so sorry for you either she may turn out all right of course she has a queer way of expressing herself a little too well too kind of forcible you know but shell likely get over that now that shes come to live among civilized folks and then her tempers pretty quick i guess but theres one comfort a child that has a quick temper just blaze up and cool down aint never likely to be sly or deceitful preserve me from a sly child thats what on the whole marilla i kind of like her  when marilla went home anne came out of the fragrant twilight of the orchard with a sheaf of white narcissi in her hands  i apologized pretty well didnt i she said proudly as they went down the lane i thought since i had to do it i might as well do it thoroughly  you did it thoroughly all right enough was marillas comment marilla was dismayed at finding herself inclined to laugh over the recollection she had also an uneasy feeling that she ought to scold anne for apologizing so well but then that was ridiculous she compromised with her conscience by saying severely   i hope you wont have occasion to make many more such apologies i hope youll try to control your temper now anne  that wouldnt be so hard if people wouldnt twit me about my looks  said anne with a sigh i dont get cross about other things but im so tired of being twitted about my hair and it just makes me boil right over do you suppose my hair will really be a handsome auburn when i grow up  you shouldnt think so much about your looks anne im afraid you are a very vain little girl  how can i be vain when i know im homely protested anne i love pretty things and i hate to look in the glass and see something that isnt pretty it makes me feel so sorrowful just as i feel when i look at any ugly thing i pity it because it isnt beautiful  handsome is as handsome does quoted marilla ive had that said to me before but i have my doubts about it remarked skeptical anne sniffing at her narcissi oh arent these flowers sweet it was lovely of mrs lynde to give them to me i have no hard feelings against mrs lynde now it gives you a lovely comfortable feeling to apologize and be forgiven doesnt it arent the stars bright tonight if you could live in a star which one would you pick id like that lovely clear big one away over there above that dark hill  anne do hold your tongue said marilla thoroughly worn out trying to follow the gyrations of annes thoughts  anne said no more until they turned into their own lane a little gypsy wind came down it to meet them laden with the spicy perfume of young dew wet ferns far up in the shadows a cheerful light gleamed out through the trees from the kitchen at green gables anne suddenly came close to marilla and slipped her hand into the older womans hard palm  its lovely to be going home and know its home she said i love green gables already and i never loved any place before no place ever seemed like home oh marilla im so happy i could pray right now and not find it a bit hard  something warm and pleasant welled up in marillas heart at touch of that thin little hand in her own a throb of the maternity she had missed perhaps its very unaccustomedness and sweetness disturbed her she hastened to restore her sensations to their normal calm by inculcating a moral  if youll be a good girl youll always be happy anne and you should never find it hard to say your prayers  saying ones prayers isnt exactly the same thing as praying said anne meditatively but im going to imagine that im the wind that is blowing up there in those tree tops when i get tired of the trees ill imagine im gently waving down here in the ferns and then ill fly over to mrs lyndes garden and set the flowers dancing and then ill go with one great swoop over the clover field and then ill blow over the lake of shining waters and ripple it all up into little sparkling waves oh theres so much scope for imagination in a wind so ill not talk any more just now marilla  thanks be to goodness for that breathed marilla in devout relief     chapter xi annes impressions of sunday school   well how do you like them said marilla  anne was standing in the gable room looking solemnly at three new dresses spread out on the bed one was of snuffy colored gingham which marilla had been tempted to buy from a peddler the preceding summer because it looked so serviceable one was of black and white checkered sateen which she had picked up at a bargain counter in the winter and one was a stiff print of an ugly blue shade which she had purchased that week at a carmody store  she had made them up herself and they were all made alike plain skirts fulled tightly to plain waists with sleeves as plain as waist and skirt and tight as sleeves could be  ill imagine that i like them said anne soberly  i dont want you to imagine it said marilla offended oh i can see you dont like the dresses what is the matter with them arent they neat and clean and new  yes  then why dont you like them  theyre theyre not pretty said anne reluctantly  pretty marilla sniffed i didnt trouble my head about getting pretty dresses for you i dont believe in pampering vanity anne ill tell you that right off those dresses are good sensible serviceable dresses without any frills or furbelows about them and theyre all youll get this summer the brown gingham and the blue print will do you for school when you begin to go the sateen is for church and sunday school ill expect you to keep them neat and clean and not to tear them i should think youd be grateful to get most anything after those skimpy wincey things youve been wearing  oh i am grateful protested anne but id be ever so much gratefuller if if youd made just one of them with puffed sleeves puffed sleeves are so fashionable now it would give me such a thrill marilla just to wear a dress with puffed sleeves  well youll have to do without your thrill i hadnt any material to waste on puffed sleeves i think they are ridiculous looking things anyhow i prefer the plain sensible ones  but id rather look ridiculous when everybody else does than plain and sensible all by myself persisted anne mournfully  trust you for that well hang those dresses carefully up in your closet and then sit down and learn the sunday school lesson i got a quarterly from mr bell for you and youll go to sunday school tomorrow said marilla disappearing downstairs in high dudgeon  anne clasped her hands and looked at the dresses  i did hope there would be a white one with puffed sleeves she whispered disconsolately i prayed for one but i didnt much expect it on that account i didnt suppose god would have time to bother about a little orphan girls dress i knew id just have to depend on marilla for it well fortunately i can imagine that one of them is of snow white muslin with lovely lace frills and three puffed sleeves  the next morning warnings of a sick headache prevented marilla from going to sunday school with anne  youll have to go down and call for mrs lynde anne she said shell see that you get into the right class now mind you behave yourself properly stay to preaching afterwards and ask mrs lynde to show you our pew heres a cent for collection dont stare at people and dont fidget i shall expect you to tell me the text when you come home  anne started off irreproachable arrayed in the stiff black and white sateen which while decent as regards length and certainly not open to the charge of skimpiness contrived to emphasize every corner and angle of her thin figure her hat was a little flat glossy new sailor the extreme plainness of which had likewise much disappointed anne who had permitted herself secret visions of ribbon and flowers the latter however were supplied before anne reached the main road for being confronted halfway down the lane with a golden frenzy of wind stirred buttercups and a glory of wild roses anne promptly and liberally garlanded her hat with a heavy wreath of them whatever other people might have thought of the result it satisfied anne and she tripped gaily down the road holding her ruddy head with its decoration of pink and yellow very proudly  when she had reached mrs lyndes house she found that lady gone nothing daunted anne proceeded onward to the church alone in the porch she found a crowd of little girls all more or less gaily attired in whites and blues and pinks and all staring with curious eyes at this stranger in their midst with her extraordinary head adornment avonlea little girls had already heard queer stories about anne mrs lynde said she had an awful temper jerry buote the hired boy at green gables said she talked all the time to herself or to the trees and flowers like a crazy girl they looked at her and whispered to each other behind their quarterlies nobody made any friendly advances then or later on when the opening exercises were over and anne found herself in miss rogersons class  miss rogerson was a middle aged lady who had taught a sunday school class for twenty years her method of teaching was to ask the printed questions from the quarterly and look sternly over its edge at the particular little girl she thought ought to answer the question she looked very often at anne and anne thanks to marillas drilling answered promptly but it may be questioned if she understood very much about either question or answer  she did not think she liked miss rogerson and she felt very miserable every other little girl in the class had puffed sleeves anne felt that life was really not worth living without puffed sleeves  well how did you like sunday school marilla wanted to know when anne came home her wreath having faded anne had discarded it in the lane so marilla was spared the knowledge of that for a time  i didnt like it a bit it was horrid  anne shirley said marilla rebukingly  anne sat down on the rocker with a long sigh kissed one of bonnys leaves and waved her hand to a blossoming fuchsia  they might have been lonesome while i was away she explained and now about the sunday school i behaved well just as you told me mrs lynde was gone but i went right on myself i went into the church with a lot of other little girls and i sat in the corner of a pew by the window while the opening exercises went on mr bell made an awfully long prayer i would have been dreadfully tired before he got through if i hadnt been sitting by that window but it looked right out on the lake of shining waters so i just gazed at that and imagined all sorts of splendid things  you shouldnt have done anything of the sort you should have listened to mr bell  but he wasnt talking to me protested anne he was talking to god and he didnt seem to be very much interested in it either i think he thought god was too far off though there was a long row of white birches hanging over the lake and the sunshine fell down through them ‘way ‘way down deep into the water oh marilla it was like a beautiful dream it gave me a thrill and i just said ‘thank you for it god two or three times  not out loud i hope said marilla anxiously  oh no just under my breath well mr bell did get through at last and they told me to go into the classroom with miss rogersons class there were nine other girls in it they all had puffed sleeves i tried to imagine mine were puffed too but i couldnt why couldnt i it was as easy as could be to imagine they were puffed when i was alone in the east gable but it was awfully hard there among the others who had really truly puffs  you shouldnt have been thinking about your sleeves in sunday school you should have been attending to the lesson i hope you knew it  oh yes and i answered a lot of questions miss rogerson asked ever so many i dont think it was fair for her to do all the asking there were lots i wanted to ask her but i didnt like to because i didnt think she was a kindred spirit then all the other little girls recited a paraphrase she asked me if i knew any i told her i didnt but i could recite ‘the dog at his masters grave if she liked thats in the third royal reader it isnt a really truly religious piece of poetry but its so sad and melancholy that it might as well be she said it wouldnt do and she told me to learn the nineteenth paraphrase for next sunday i read it over in church afterwards and its splendid there are two lines in particular that just thrill me     ‘quick as the slaughtered squadrons fell      in midians evil day  i dont know what ‘squadrons means nor ‘midian either but it sounds so tragical i can hardly wait until next sunday to recite it ill practice it all the week after sunday school i asked miss rogerson because mrs lynde was too far away to show me your pew i sat just as still as i could and the text was revelations third chapter second and third verses it was a very long text if i was a minister id pick the short snappy ones the sermon was awfully long too i suppose the minister had to match it to the text i didnt think he was a bit interesting the trouble with him seems to be that he hasnt enough imagination i didnt listen to him very much i just let my thoughts run and i thought of the most surprising things  marilla felt helplessly that all this should be sternly reproved but she was hampered by the undeniable fact that some of the things anne had said especially about the ministers sermons and mr bells prayers were what she herself had really thought deep down in her heart for years but had never given expression to it almost seemed to her that those secret unuttered critical thoughts had suddenly taken visible and accusing shape and form in the person of this outspoken morsel of neglected humanity     chapter xii a solemn vow and promise   it was not until the next friday that marilla heard the story of the flower wreathed hat she came home from mrs lyndes and called anne to account  anne mrs rachel says you went to church last sunday with your hat rigged out ridiculous with roses and buttercups what on earth put you up to such a caper a pretty looking object you must have been  oh i know pink and yellow arent becoming to me began anne  becoming fiddlesticks it was putting flowers on your hat at all no matter what color they were that was ridiculous you are the most aggravating child  i dont see why its any more ridiculous to wear flowers on your hat than on your dress protested anne lots of little girls there had bouquets pinned on their dresses whats the difference  marilla was not to be drawn from the safe concrete into dubious paths of the abstract  dont answer me back like that anne it was very silly of you to do such a thing never let me catch you at such a trick again mrs rachel says she thought she would sink through the floor when she saw you come in all rigged out like that she couldnt get near enough to tell you to take them off till it was too late she says people talked about it something dreadful of course they would think i had no better sense than to let you go decked out like that  oh im so sorry said anne tears welling into her eyes i never thought youd mind the roses and buttercups were so sweet and pretty i thought theyd look lovely on my hat lots of the little girls had artificial flowers on their hats im afraid im going to be a dreadful trial to you maybe youd better send me back to the asylum that would be terrible i dont think i could endure it most likely i would go into consumption im so thin as it is you see but that would be better than being a trial to you  nonsense said marilla vexed at herself for having made the child cry i dont want to send you back to the asylum im sure all i want is that you should behave like other little girls and not make yourself ridiculous dont cry any more ive got some news for you diana barry came home this afternoon im going up to see if i can borrow a skirt pattern from mrs barry and if you like you can come with me and get acquainted with diana  anne rose to her feet with clasped hands the tears still glistening on her cheeks the dish towel she had been hemming slipped unheeded to the floor  oh marilla im frightened now that it has come im actually frightened what if she shouldnt like me it would be the most tragical disappointment of my life  now dont get into a fluster and i do wish you wouldnt use such long words it sounds so funny in a little girl i guess diana ‘ll like you well enough its her mother youve got to reckon with if she doesnt like you it wont matter how much diana does if she has heard about your outburst to mrs lynde and going to church with buttercups round your hat i dont know what shell think of you you must be polite and well behaved and dont make any of your startling speeches for pitys sake if the child isnt actually trembling  anne was trembling her face was pale and tense  oh marilla youd be excited too if you were going to meet a little girl you hoped to be your bosom friend and whose mother mightnt like you she said as she hastened to get her hat  they went over to orchard slope by the short cut across the brook and up the firry hill grove mrs barry came to the kitchen door in answer to marillas knock she was a tall black eyed black haired woman with a very resolute mouth she had the reputation of being very strict with her children  how do you do marilla she said cordially come in and this is the little girl you have adopted i suppose  yes this is anne shirley said marilla  spelled with an e gasped anne who tremulous and excited as she was was determined there should be no misunderstanding on that important point  mrs barry not hearing or not comprehending merely shook hands and said kindly   how are you  i am well in body although considerable rumpled up in spirit thank you maam said anne gravely then aside to marilla in an audible whisper there wasnt anything startling in that was there marilla  diana was sitting on the sofa reading a book which she dropped when the callers entered she was a very pretty little girl with her mothers black eyes and hair and rosy cheeks and the merry expression which was her inheritance from her father  this is my little girl diana said mrs barry diana you might take anne out into the garden and show her your flowers it will be better for you than straining your eyes over that book she reads entirely too much  this to marilla as the little girls went out and i cant prevent her for her father aids and abets her shes always poring over a book im glad she has the prospect of a playmate perhaps it will take her more out of doors  outside in the garden which was full of mellow sunset light streaming through the dark old firs to the west of it stood anne and diana gazing bashfully at each other over a clump of gorgeous tiger lilies  the barry garden was a bowery wilderness of flowers which would have delighted annes heart at any time less fraught with destiny it was encircled by huge old willows and tall firs beneath which flourished flowers that loved the shade prim right angled paths neatly bordered with clamshells intersected it like moist red ribbons and in the beds between old fashioned flowers ran riot there were rosy bleeding hearts and great splendid crimson peonies white fragrant narcissi and thorny sweet scotch roses pink and blue and white columbines and lilac tinted bouncing bets clumps of southernwood and ribbon grass and mint purple adam and eve daffodils and masses of sweet clover white with its delicate fragrant feathery sprays scarlet lightning that shot its fiery lances over prim white musk flowers a garden it was where sunshine lingered and bees hummed and winds beguiled into loitering purred and rustled  oh diana said anne at last clasping her hands and speaking almost in a whisper oh do you think you can like me a little enough to be my bosom friend  diana laughed diana always laughed before she spoke  why i guess so she said frankly im awfully glad youve come to live at green gables it will be jolly to have somebody to play with there isnt any other girl who lives near enough to play with and ive no sisters big enough  will you swear to be my friend forever and ever demanded anne eagerly  diana looked shocked  why its dreadfully wicked to swear she said rebukingly  oh no not my kind of swearing there are two kinds you know  i never heard of but one kind said diana doubtfully  there really is another oh it isnt wicked at all it just means vowing and promising solemnly  well i dont mind doing that agreed diana relieved how do you do it  we must join hands so said anne gravely it ought to be over running water well just imagine this path is running water ill repeat the oath first i solemnly swear to be faithful to my bosom friend diana barry as long as the sun and moon shall endure now you say it and put my name in  diana repeated the oath with a laugh fore and aft then she said   youre a queer girl anne i heard before that you were queer but i believe im going to like you real well  when marilla and anne went home diana went with them as far as the log bridge the two little girls walked with their arms about each other at the brook they parted with many promises to spend the next afternoon together  well did you find diana a kindred spirit asked marilla as they went up through the garden of green gables  oh yes sighed anne blissfully unconscious of any sarcasm on marillas part oh marilla im the happiest girl on prince edward island this very moment i assure you ill say my prayers with a right good will tonight diana and i are going to build a playhouse in mr william bells birch grove tomorrow can i have those broken pieces of china that are out in the woodshed dianas birthday is in february and mine is in march dont you think that is a very strange coincidence diana is going to lend me a book to read she says its perfectly splendid and tremendously exciting shes going to show me a place back in the woods where rice lilies grow dont you think diana has got very soulful eyes i wish i had soulful eyes diana is going to teach me to sing a song called ‘nelly in the hazel dell shes going to give me a picture to put up in my room its a perfectly beautiful picture she says a lovely lady in a pale blue silk dress a sewing machine agent gave it to her i wish i had something to give diana im an inch taller than diana but she is ever so much fatter she says shed like to be thin because its so much more graceful but im afraid she only said it to soothe my feelings were going to the shore some day to gather shells we have agreed to call the spring down by the log bridge the dryads bubble isnt that a perfectly elegant name i read a story once about a spring called that a dryad is sort of a grown up fairy i think  well all i hope is you wont talk diana to death said marilla but remember this in all your planning anne youre not going to play all the time nor most of it youll have your work to do and itll have to be done first  annes cup of happiness was full and matthew caused it to overflow he had just got home from a trip to the store at carmody and he sheepishly produced a small parcel from his pocket and handed it to anne with a deprecatory look at marilla  i heard you say you liked chocolate sweeties so i got you some he said  humph sniffed marilla itll ruin her teeth and stomach there there child dont look so dismal you can eat those since matthew has gone and got them hed better have brought you peppermints theyre wholesomer dont sicken yourself eating all them at once now  oh no indeed i wont said anne eagerly ill just eat one tonight marilla and i can give diana half of them cant i the other half will taste twice as sweet to me if i give some to her its delightful to think i have something to give her  i will say it for the child said marilla when anne had gone to her gable she isnt stingy im glad for of all faults i detest stinginess in a child dear me its only three weeks since she came and it seems as if shed been here always i cant imagine the place without her now dont be looking i told you so matthew thats bad enough in a woman but it isnt to be endured in a man im perfectly willing to own up that im glad i consented to keep the child and that im getting fond of her but dont you rub it in matthew cuthbert     chapter xiii the delights of anticipation   its time anne was in to do her sewing said marilla glancing at the clock and then out into the yellow august afternoon where everything drowsed in the heat she stayed playing with diana more than half an hour more ‘n i gave her leave to and now shes perched out there on the woodpile talking to matthew nineteen to the dozen when she knows perfectly well she ought to be at her work and of course hes listening to her like a perfect ninny i never saw such an infatuated man the more she talks and the odder the things she says the more hes delighted evidently anne shirley you come right in here this minute do you hear me  a series of staccato taps on the west window brought anne flying in from the yard eyes shining cheeks faintly flushed with pink unbraided hair streaming behind her in a torrent of brightness  oh marilla she exclaimed breathlessly theres going to be a sunday school picnic next week in mr harmon andrewss field right near the lake of shining waters and mrs superintendent bell and mrs rachel lynde are going to make ice cream think of it marilla ice cream and oh marilla can i go to it  just look at the clock if you please anne what time did i tell you to come in  two oclock but isnt it splendid about the picnic marilla please can i go oh ive never been to a picnic ive dreamed of picnics but ive never   yes i told you to come at two oclock and its a quarter to three id like to know why you didnt obey me anne  why i meant to marilla as much as could be but you have no idea how fascinating idlewild is and then of course i had to tell matthew about the picnic matthew is such a sympathetic listener please can i go  youll have to learn to resist the fascination of idle whatever you call it when i tell you to come in at a certain time i mean that time and not half an hour later and you neednt stop to discourse with sympathetic listeners on your way either as for the picnic of course you can go youre a sunday school scholar and its not likely id refuse to let you go when all the other little girls are going  but but faltered anne diana says that everybody must take a basket of things to eat i cant cook as you know marilla and and i dont mind going to a picnic without puffed sleeves so much but id feel terribly humiliated if i had to go without a basket its been preying on my mind ever since diana told me  well it neednt prey any longer ill bake you a basket  oh you dear good marilla oh you are so kind to me oh im so much obliged to you  getting through with her ohs anne cast herself into marillas arms and rapturously kissed her sallow cheek it was the first time in her whole life that childish lips had voluntarily touched marillas face again that sudden sensation of startling sweetness thrilled her she was secretly vastly pleased at annes impulsive caress which was probably the reason why she said brusquely   there there never mind your kissing nonsense id sooner see you doing strictly as youre told as for cooking i mean to begin giving you lessons in that some of these days but youre so featherbrained anne ive been waiting to see if youd sober down a little and learn to be steady before i begin youve got to keep your wits about you in cooking and not stop in the middle of things to let your thoughts rove all over creation now get out your patchwork and have your square done before teatime  i do not like patchwork said anne dolefully hunting out her workbasket and sitting down before a little heap of red and white diamonds with a sigh i think some kinds of sewing would be nice but theres no scope for imagination in patchwork its just one little seam after another and you never seem to be getting anywhere but of course id rather be anne of green gables sewing patchwork than anne of any other place with nothing to do but play i wish time went as quick sewing patches as it does when im playing with diana though oh we do have such elegant times marilla i have to furnish most of the imagination but im well able to do that diana is simply perfect in every other way you know that little piece of land across the brook that runs up between our farm and mr barrys it belongs to mr william bell and right in the corner there is a little ring of white birch trees the most romantic spot marilla diana and i have our playhouse there we call it idlewild isnt that a poetical name i assure you it took me some time to think it out i stayed awake nearly a whole night before i invented it then just as i was dropping off to sleep it came like an inspiration diana was enraptured when she heard it we have got our house fixed up elegantly you must come and see it marilla wont you we have great big stones all covered with moss for seats and boards from tree to tree for shelves and we have all our dishes on them of course theyre all broken but its the easiest thing in the world to imagine that they are whole theres a piece of a plate with a spray of red and yellow ivy on it that is especially beautiful we keep it in the parlor and we have the fairy glass there too the fairy glass is as lovely as a dream diana found it out in the woods behind their chicken house its all full of rainbows just little young rainbows that havent grown big yet and dianas mother told her it was broken off a hanging lamp they once had but its nice to imagine the fairies lost it one night when they had a ball so we call it the fairy glass matthew is going to make us a table oh we have named that little round pool over in mr barrys field willowmere i got that name out of the book diana lent me that was a thrilling book marilla the heroine had five lovers id be satisfied with one wouldnt you she was very handsome and she went through great tribulations she could faint as easy as anything id love to be able to faint wouldnt you marilla its so romantic but im really very healthy for all im so thin i believe im getting fatter though dont you think i am i look at my elbows every morning when i get up to see if any dimples are coming diana is having a new dress made with elbow sleeves she is going to wear it to the picnic oh i do hope it will be fine next wednesday i dont feel that i could endure the disappointment if anything happened to prevent me from getting to the picnic i suppose id live through it but im certain it would be a lifelong sorrow it wouldnt matter if i got to a hundred picnics in after years they wouldnt make up for missing this one theyre going to have boats on the lake of shining waters and ice cream as i told you i have never tasted ice cream diana tried to explain what it was like but i guess ice cream is one of those things that are beyond imagination  anne you have talked even on for ten minutes by the clock said marilla now just for curiositys sake see if you can hold your tongue for the same length of time  anne held her tongue as desired but for the rest of the week she talked picnic and thought picnic and dreamed picnic on saturday it rained and she worked herself up into such a frantic state lest it should keep on raining until and over wednesday that marilla made her sew an extra patchwork square by way of steadying her nerves  on sunday anne confided to marilla on the way home from church that she grew actually cold all over with excitement when the minister announced the picnic from the pulpit  such a thrill as went up and down my back marilla i dont think id ever really believed until then that there was honestly going to be a picnic i couldnt help fearing id only imagined it but when a minister says a thing in the pulpit you just have to believe it  you set your heart too much on things anne said marilla with a sigh im afraid therell be a great many disappointments in store for you through life  oh marilla looking forward to things is half the pleasure of them  exclaimed anne you maynt get the things themselves but nothing can prevent you from having the fun of looking forward to them mrs lynde says ‘blessed are they who expect nothing for they shall not be disappointed but i think it would be worse to expect nothing than to be disappointed  marilla wore her amethyst brooch to church that day as usual marilla always wore her amethyst brooch to church she would have thought it rather sacrilegious to leave it off as bad as forgetting her bible or her collection dime that amethyst brooch was marillas most treasured possession a seafaring uncle had given it to her mother who in turn had bequeathed it to marilla it was an old fashioned oval containing a braid of her mothers hair surrounded by a border of very fine amethysts marilla knew too little about precious stones to realize how fine the amethysts actually were but she thought them very beautiful and was always pleasantly conscious of their violet shimmer at her throat above her good brown satin dress even although she could not see it  anne had been smitten with delighted admiration when she first saw that brooch  oh marilla its a perfectly elegant brooch i dont know how you can pay attention to the sermon or the prayers when you have it on i couldnt i know i think amethysts are just sweet they are what i used to think diamonds were like long ago before i had ever seen a diamond i read about them and i tried to imagine what they would be like i thought they would be lovely glimmering purple stones when i saw a real diamond in a ladys ring one day i was so disappointed i cried of course it was very lovely but it wasnt my idea of a diamond will you let me hold the brooch for one minute marilla do you think amethysts can be the souls of good violets     chapter xiv annes confession   on the monday evening before the picnic marilla came down from her room with a troubled face  anne she said to that small personage who was shelling peas by the spotless table and singing nelly of the hazel dell with a vigor and expression that did credit to dianas teaching did you see anything of my amethyst brooch i thought i stuck it in my pincushion when i came home from church yesterday evening but i cant find it anywhere  i i saw it this afternoon when you were away at the aid society said anne a little slowly i was passing your door when i saw it on the cushion so i went in to look at it  did you touch it said marilla sternly  y e e s admitted anne i took it up and i pinned it on my breast just to see how it would look  you had no business to do anything of the sort its very wrong in a little girl to meddle you shouldnt have gone into my room in the first place and you shouldnt have touched a brooch that didnt belong to you in the second where did you put it  oh i put it back on the bureau i hadnt it on a minute truly i didnt mean to meddle marilla i didnt think about its being wrong to go in and try on the brooch but i see now that it was and ill never do it again thats one good thing about me i never do the same naughty thing twice  you didnt put it back said marilla that brooch isnt anywhere on the bureau youve taken it out or something anne  i did put it back said anne quickly pertly marilla thought i dont just remember whether i stuck it on the pincushion or laid it in the china tray but im perfectly certain i put it back  ill go and have another look said marilla determining to be just if you put that brooch back its there still if it isnt ill know you didnt thats all  marilla went to her room and made a thorough search not only over the bureau but in every other place she thought the brooch might possibly be it was not to be found and she returned to the kitchen  anne the brooch is gone by your own admission you were the last person to handle it now what have you done with it tell me the truth at once did you take it out and lose it  no i didnt said anne solemnly meeting marillas angry gaze squarely i never took the brooch out of your room and that is the truth if i was to be led to the block for it although im not very certain what a block is so there marilla  annes so there was only intended to emphasize her assertion but marilla took it as a display of defiance  i believe you are telling me a falsehood anne she said sharply i know you are there now dont say anything more unless you are prepared to tell the whole truth go to your room and stay there until you are ready to confess  will i take the peas with me said anne meekly  no ill finish shelling them myself do as i bid you  when anne had gone marilla went about her evening tasks in a very disturbed state of mind she was worried about her valuable brooch what if anne had lost it and how wicked of the child to deny having taken it when anybody could see she must have with such an innocent face too  i dont know what i wouldnt sooner have had happen thought marilla as she nervously shelled the peas of course i dont suppose she meant to steal it or anything like that shes just taken it to play with or help along that imagination of hers she must have taken it thats clear for there hasnt been a soul in that room since she was in it by her own story until i went up tonight and the brooch is gone theres nothing surer i suppose she has lost it and is afraid to own up for fear shell be punished its a dreadful thing to think she tells falsehoods its a far worse thing than her fit of temper its a fearful responsibility to have a child in your house you cant trust slyness and untruthfulness thats what she has displayed i declare i feel worse about that than about the brooch if shed only have told the truth about it i wouldnt mind so much  marilla went to her room at intervals all through the evening and searched for the brooch without finding it a bedtime visit to the east gable produced no result anne persisted in denying that she knew anything about the brooch but marilla was only the more firmly convinced that she did  she told matthew the story the next morning matthew was confounded and puzzled he could not so quickly lose faith in anne but he had to admit that circumstances were against her  youre sure it hasnt fell down behind the bureau was the only suggestion he could offer  ive moved the bureau and ive taken out the drawers and ive looked in every crack and cranny was marillas positive answer the brooch is gone and that child has taken it and lied about it thats the plain ugly truth matthew cuthbert and we might as well look it in the face  well now what are you going to do about it matthew asked forlornly feeling secretly thankful that marilla and not he had to deal with the situation he felt no desire to put his oar in this time  shell stay in her room until she confesses said marilla grimly remembering the success of this method in the former case then well see perhaps well be able to find the brooch if shell only tell where she took it but in any case shell have to be severely punished matthew  well now youll have to punish her said matthew reaching for his hat ive nothing to do with it remember you warned me off yourself  marilla felt deserted by everyone she could not even go to mrs lynde for advice she went up to the east gable with a very serious face and left it with a face more serious still anne steadfastly refused to confess she persisted in asserting that she had not taken the brooch the child had evidently been crying and marilla felt a pang of pity which she sternly repressed by night she was as she expressed it beat out  youll stay in this room until you confess anne you can make up your mind to that she said firmly  but the picnic is tomorrow marilla cried anne you wont keep me from going to that will you youll just let me out for the afternoon wont you then ill stay here as long as you like afterwards cheerfully but i must go to the picnic  youll not go to picnics nor anywhere else until youve confessed anne  oh marilla gasped anne  but marilla had gone out and shut the door  wednesday morning dawned as bright and fair as if expressly made to order for the picnic birds sang around green gables the madonna lilies in the garden sent out whiffs of perfume that entered in on viewless winds at every door and window and wandered through halls and rooms like spirits of benediction the birches in the hollow waved joyful hands as if watching for annes usual morning greeting from the east gable but anne was not at her window when marilla took her breakfast up to her she found the child sitting primly on her bed pale and resolute with tight shut lips and gleaming eyes  marilla im ready to confess  ah marilla laid down her tray once again her method had succeeded but her success was very bitter to her let me hear what you have to say then anne  i took the amethyst brooch said anne as if repeating a lesson she had learned i took it just as you said i didnt mean to take it when i went in but it did look so beautiful marilla when i pinned it on my breast that i was overcome by an irresistible temptation i imagined how perfectly thrilling it would be to take it to idlewild and play i was the lady cordelia fitzgerald it would be so much easier to imagine i was the lady cordelia if i had a real amethyst brooch on diana and i make necklaces of roseberries but what are roseberries compared to amethysts so i took the brooch i thought i could put it back before you came home i went all the way around by the road to lengthen out the time when i was going over the bridge across the lake of shining waters i took the brooch off to have another look at it oh how it did shine in the sunlight and then when i was leaning over the bridge it just slipped through my fingers so and went down down down all purply sparkling and sank forevermore beneath the lake of shining waters and thats the best i can do at confessing marilla  marilla felt hot anger surge up into her heart again this child had taken and lost her treasured amethyst brooch and now sat there calmly reciting the details thereof without the least apparent compunction or repentance  anne this is terrible she said trying to speak calmly you are the very wickedest girl i ever heard of  yes i suppose i am agreed anne tranquilly and i know ill have to be punished itll be your duty to punish me marilla wont you please get it over right off because id like to go to the picnic with nothing on my mind  picnic indeed youll go to no picnic today anne shirley that shall be your punishment and it isnt half severe enough either for what youve done  not go to the picnic anne sprang to her feet and clutched marillas hand but you promised me i might oh marilla i must go to the picnic that was why i confessed punish me any way you like but that oh marilla please please let me go to the picnic think of the ice cream for anything you know i may never have a chance to taste ice cream again  marilla disengaged annes clinging hands stonily  you neednt plead anne you are not going to the picnic and thats final no not a word  anne realized that marilla was not to be moved she clasped her hands together gave a piercing shriek and then flung herself face downward on the bed crying and writhing in an utter abandonment of disappointment and despair  for the lands sake gasped marilla hastening from the room i believe the child is crazy no child in her senses would behave as she does if she isnt shes utterly bad oh dear im afraid rachel was right from the first but ive put my hand to the plow and i wont look back  that was a dismal morning marilla worked fiercely and scrubbed the porch floor and the dairy shelves when she could find nothing else to do neither the shelves nor the porch needed it but marilla did then she went out and raked the yard  when dinner was ready she went to the stairs and called anne a tear stained face appeared looking tragically over the banisters  come down to your dinner anne  i dont want any dinner marilla said anne sobbingly i couldnt eat anything my heart is broken youll feel remorse of conscience someday i expect for breaking it marilla but i forgive you remember when the time comes that i forgive you but please dont ask me to eat anything especially boiled pork and greens boiled pork and greens are so unromantic when one is in affliction  exasperated marilla returned to the kitchen and poured out her tale of woe to matthew who between his sense of justice and his unlawful sympathy with anne was a miserable man  well now she shouldnt have taken the brooch marilla or told stories about it he admitted mournfully surveying his plateful of unromantic pork and greens as if he like anne thought it a food unsuited to crises of feeling but shes such a little thing such an interesting little thing dont you think its pretty rough not to let her go to the picnic when shes so set on it  matthew cuthbert im amazed at you i think ive let her off entirely too easy and she doesnt appear to realize how wicked shes been at all thats what worries me most if shed really felt sorry it wouldnt be so bad and you dont seem to realize it neither youre making excuses for her all the time to yourself i can see that  well now shes such a little thing feebly reiterated matthew and there should be allowances made marilla you know shes never had any bringing up  well shes having it now retorted marilla  the retort silenced matthew if it did not convince him that dinner was a very dismal meal the only cheerful thing about it was jerry buote the hired boy and marilla resented his cheerfulness as a personal insult  when her dishes were washed and her bread sponge set and her hens fed marilla remembered that she had noticed a small rent in her best black lace shawl when she had taken it off on monday afternoon on returning from the ladies aid  she would go and mend it the shawl was in a box in her trunk as marilla lifted it out the sunlight falling through the vines that clustered thickly about the window struck upon something caught in the shawl something that glittered and sparkled in facets of violet light marilla snatched at it with a gasp it was the amethyst brooch hanging to a thread of the lace by its catch  dear life and heart said marilla blankly what does this mean heres my brooch safe and sound that i thought was at the bottom of barrys pond whatever did that girl mean by saying she took it and lost it i declare i believe green gables is bewitched i remember now that when i took off my shawl monday afternoon i laid it on the bureau for a minute i suppose the brooch got caught in it somehow well  marilla betook herself to the east gable brooch in hand anne had cried herself out and was sitting dejectedly by the window  anne shirley said marilla solemnly ive just found my brooch hanging to my black lace shawl now i want to know what that rigmarole you told me this morning meant  why you said youd keep me here until i confessed returned anne wearily and so i decided to confess because i was bound to get to the picnic i thought out a confession last night after i went to bed and made it as interesting as i could and i said it over and over so that i wouldnt forget it but you wouldnt let me go to the picnic after all so all my trouble was wasted  marilla had to laugh in spite of herself but her conscience pricked her  anne you do beat all but i was wrong i see that now i shouldnt have doubted your word when id never known you to tell a story of course it wasnt right for you to confess to a thing you hadnt done it was very wrong to do so but i drove you to it so if youll forgive me anne ill forgive you and well start square again and now get yourself ready for the picnic  anne flew up like a rocket  oh marilla isnt it too late  no its only two oclock they wont be more than well gathered yet and itll be an hour before they have tea wash your face and comb your hair and put on your gingham ill fill a basket for you theres plenty of stuff baked in the house and ill get jerry to hitch up the sorrel and drive you down to the picnic ground  oh marilla exclaimed anne flying to the wash stand five minutes ago i was so miserable i was wishing id never been born and now i wouldnt change places with an angel  that night a thoroughly happy completely tired out anne returned to green gables in a state of beatification impossible to describe  oh marilla ive had a perfectly scrumptious time scrumptious is a new word i learned today i heard mary alice bell use it isnt it very expressive everything was lovely we had a splendid tea and then mr harmon andrews took us all for a row on the lake of shining waters six of us at a time and jane andrews nearly fell overboard she was leaning out to pick water lilies and if mr andrews hadnt caught her by her sash just in the nick of time shed fallen in and probly been drowned i wish it had been me it would have been such a romantic experience to have been nearly drowned it would be such a thrilling tale to tell and we had the ice cream words fail me to describe that ice cream marilla i assure you it was sublime  that evening marilla told the whole story to matthew over her stocking basket  im willing to own up that i made a mistake she concluded candidly but ive learned a lesson i have to laugh when i think of annes ‘confession although i suppose i shouldnt for it really was a falsehood but it doesnt seem as bad as the other would have been somehow and anyhow im responsible for it that child is hard to understand in some respects but i believe shell turn out all right yet and theres one thing certain no house will ever be dull that shes in     chapter xv a tempest in the school teapot   what a splendid day said anne drawing a long breath isnt it good just to be alive on a day like this i pity the people who arent born yet for missing it they may have good days of course but they can never have this one and its splendider still to have such a lovely way to go to school by isnt it  its a lot nicer than going round by the road that is so dusty and hot said diana practically peeping into her dinner basket and mentally calculating if the three juicy toothsome raspberry tarts reposing there were divided among ten girls how many bites each girl would have  the little girls of avonlea school always pooled their lunches and to eat three raspberry tarts all alone or even to share them only with ones best chum would have forever and ever branded as awful mean the girl who did it and yet when the tarts were divided among ten girls you just got enough to tantalize you  the way anne and diana went to school was a pretty one anne thought those walks to and from school with diana couldnt be improved upon even by imagination going around by the main road would have been so unromantic but to go by lovers lane and willowmere and violet vale and the birch path was romantic if ever anything was  lovers lane opened out below the orchard at green gables and stretched far up into the woods to the end of the cuthbert farm it was the way by which the cows were taken to the back pasture and the wood hauled home in winter anne had named it lovers lane before she had been a month at green gables  not that lovers ever really walk there she explained to marilla but diana and i are reading a perfectly magnificent book and theres a lovers lane in it so we want to have one too and its a very pretty name dont you think so romantic we cant imagine the lovers into it you know i like that lane because you can think out loud there without people calling you crazy  anne starting out alone in the morning went down lovers lane as far as the brook here diana met her and the two little girls went on up the lane under the leafy arch of maples maples are such sociable trees said anne theyre always rustling and whispering to you until they came to a rustic bridge then they left the lane and walked through mr barrys back field and past willowmere beyond willowmere came violet vale a little green dimple in the shadow of mr andrew bells big woods of course there are no violets there now  anne told marilla but diana says there are millions of them in spring oh marilla cant you just imagine you see them it actually takes away my breath i named it violet vale diana says she never saw the beat of me for hitting on fancy names for places its nice to be clever at something isnt it but diana named the birch path she wanted to so i let her but im sure i could have found something more poetical than plain birch path anybody can think of a name like that but the birch path is one of the prettiest places in the world marilla  it was other people besides anne thought so when they stumbled on it it was a little narrow twisting path winding down over a long hill straight through mr bells woods where the light came down sifted through so many emerald screens that it was as flawless as the heart of a diamond it was fringed in all its length with slim young birches white stemmed and lissom boughed ferns and starflowers and wild lilies of the valley and scarlet tufts of pigeonberries grew thickly along it and always there was a delightful spiciness in the air and music of bird calls and the murmur and laugh of wood winds in the trees overhead now and then you might see a rabbit skipping across the road if you were quiet which with anne and diana happened about once in a blue moon down in the valley the path came out to the main road and then it was just up the spruce hill to the school  the avonlea school was a whitewashed building low in the eaves and wide in the windows furnished inside with comfortable substantial old fashioned desks that opened and shut and were carved all over their lids with the initials and hieroglyphics of three generations of school children the schoolhouse was set back from the road and behind it was a dusky fir wood and a brook where all the children put their bottles of milk in the morning to keep cool and sweet until dinner hour  marilla had seen anne start off to school on the first day of september with many secret misgivings anne was such an odd girl how would she get on with the other children and how on earth would she ever manage to hold her tongue during school hours  things went better than marilla feared however anne came home that evening in high spirits  i think im going to like school here she announced i dont think much of the master though hes all the time curling his mustache and making eyes at prissy andrews prissy is grown up you know shes sixteen and shes studying for the entrance examination into queens academy at charlottetown next year tillie boulter says the master is dead gone on her shes got a beautiful complexion and curly brown hair and she does it up so elegantly she sits in the long seat at the back and he sits there too most of the time to explain her lessons he says but ruby gillis says she saw him writing something on her slate and when prissy read it she blushed as red as a beet and giggled and ruby gillis says she doesnt believe it had anything to do with the lesson  anne shirley dont let me hear you talking about your teacher in that way again said marilla sharply you dont go to school to criticize the master i guess he can teach you something and its your business to learn and i want you to understand right off that you are not to come home telling tales about him that is something i wont encourage i hope you were a good girl  indeed i was said anne comfortably it wasnt so hard as you might imagine either i sit with diana our seat is right by the window and we can look down to the lake of shining waters there are a lot of nice girls in school and we had scrumptious fun playing at dinnertime its so nice to have a lot of little girls to play with but of course i like diana best and always will i adore diana im dreadfully far behind the others theyre all in the fifth book and im only in the fourth i feel that its kind of a disgrace but theres not one of them has such an imagination as i have and i soon found that out we had reading and geography and canadian history and dictation today mr phillips said my spelling was disgraceful and he held up my slate so that everybody could see it all marked over i felt so mortified marilla he might have been politer to a stranger i think ruby gillis gave me an apple and sophia sloane lent me a lovely pink card with ‘may i see you home on it im to give it back to her tomorrow and tillie boulter let me wear her bead ring all the afternoon can i have some of those pearl beads off the old pincushion in the garret to make myself a ring and oh marilla jane andrews told me that minnie macpherson told her that she heard prissy andrews tell sara gillis that i had a very pretty nose marilla that is the first compliment i have ever had in my life and you cant imagine what a strange feeling it gave me marilla have i really a pretty nose i know youll tell me the truth  your nose is well enough said marilla shortly secretly she thought annes nose was a remarkable pretty one but she had no intention of telling her so  that was three weeks ago and all had gone smoothly so far and now this crisp september morning anne and diana were tripping blithely down the birch path two of the happiest little girls in avonlea  i guess gilbert blythe will be in school today said diana hes been visiting his cousins over in new brunswick all summer and he only came home saturday night hes awfly handsome anne and he teases the girls something terrible he just torments our lives out  dianas voice indicated that she rather liked having her life tormented out than not  gilbert blythe said anne isnt his name thats written up on the porch wall with julia bells and a big ‘take notice over them  yes said diana tossing her head but im sure he doesnt like julia bell so very much ive heard him say he studied the multiplication table by her freckles  oh dont speak about freckles to me implored anne it isnt delicate when ive got so many but i do think that writing take notices up on the wall about the boys and girls is the silliest ever i should just like to see anybody dare to write my name up with a boys not of course she hastened to add that anybody would  anne sighed she didnt want her name written up but it was a little humiliating to know that there was no danger of it  nonsense said diana whose black eyes and glossy tresses had played such havoc with the hearts of avonlea schoolboys that her name figured on the porch walls in half a dozen take notices its only meant as a joke and dont you be too sure your name wont ever be written up charlie sloane is dead gone on you he told his mother his mother mind you that you were the smartest girl in school thats better than being good looking  no it isnt said anne feminine to the core id rather be pretty than clever and i hate charlie sloane i cant bear a boy with goggle eyes if anyone wrote my name up with his id never get over it diana barry but it is nice to keep head of your class  youll have gilbert in your class after this said diana and hes used to being head of his class i can tell you hes only in the fourth book although hes nearly fourteen four years ago his father was sick and had to go out to alberta for his health and gilbert went with him they were there three years and gil didnt go to school hardly any until they came back you wont find it so easy to keep head after this anne  im glad said anne quickly i couldnt really feel proud of keeping head of little boys and girls of just nine or ten i got up yesterday spelling ‘ebullition josie pye was head and mind you she peeped in her book mr phillips didnt see her he was looking at prissy andrews but i did i just swept her a look of freezing scorn and she got as red as a beet and spelled it wrong after all  those pye girls are cheats all round said diana indignantly as they climbed the fence of the main road gertie pye actually went and put her milk bottle in my place in the brook yesterday did you ever i dont speak to her now  when mr phillips was in the back of the room hearing prissy andrewss latin diana whispered to anne thats gilbert blythe sitting right across the aisle from you anne just look at him and see if you dont think hes handsome  anne looked accordingly she had a good chance to do so for the said gilbert blythe was absorbed in stealthily pinning the long yellow braid of ruby gillis who sat in front of him to the back of her seat he was a tall boy with curly brown hair roguish hazel eyes and a mouth twisted into a teasing smile presently ruby gillis started up to take a sum to the master she fell back into her seat with a little shriek believing that her hair was pulled out by the roots everybody looked at her and mr phillips glared so sternly that ruby began to cry gilbert had whisked the pin out of sight and was studying his history with the soberest face in the world but when the commotion subsided he looked at anne and winked with inexpressible drollery  i think your gilbert blythe is handsome confided anne to diana but i think hes very bold it isnt good manners to wink at a strange girl  but it was not until the afternoon that things really began to happen  mr phillips was back in the corner explaining a problem in algebra to prissy andrews and the rest of the scholars were doing pretty much as they pleased eating green apples whispering drawing pictures on their slates and driving crickets harnessed to strings up and down aisle gilbert blythe was trying to make anne shirley look at him and failing utterly because anne was at that moment totally oblivious not only to the very existence of gilbert blythe but of every other scholar in avonlea school itself with her chin propped on her hands and her eyes fixed on the blue glimpse of the lake of shining waters that the west window afforded she was far away in a gorgeous dreamland hearing and seeing nothing save her own wonderful visions  gilbert blythe wasnt used to putting himself out to make a girl look at him and meeting with failure she should look at him that red haired shirley girl with the little pointed chin and the big eyes that werent like the eyes of any other girl in avonlea school  gilbert reached across the aisle picked up the end of annes long red braid held it out at arms length and said in a piercing whisper   carrots carrots  then anne looked at him with a vengeance  she did more than look she sprang to her feet her bright fancies fallen into cureless ruin she flashed one indignant glance at gilbert from eyes whose angry sparkle was swiftly quenched in equally angry tears  you mean hateful boy she exclaimed passionately how dare you  and then thwack anne had brought her slate down on gilberts head and cracked it slate not head clear across  avonlea school always enjoyed a scene this was an especially enjoyable one everybody said oh in horrified delight diana gasped ruby gillis who was inclined to be hysterical began to cry tommy sloane let his team of crickets escape him altogether while he stared open mouthed at the tableau  mr phillips stalked down the aisle and laid his hand heavily on annes shoulder  anne shirley what does this mean he said angrily anne returned no answer it was asking too much of flesh and blood to expect her to tell before the whole school that she had been called carrots gilbert it was who spoke up stoutly  it was my fault mr phillips i teased her  mr phillips paid no heed to gilbert  i am sorry to see a pupil of mine displaying such a temper and such a vindictive spirit he said in a solemn tone as if the mere fact of being a pupil of his ought to root out all evil passions from the hearts of small imperfect mortals anne go and stand on the platform in front of the blackboard for the rest of the afternoon  anne would have infinitely preferred a whipping to this punishment under which her sensitive spirit quivered as from a whiplash with a white set face she obeyed mr phillips took a chalk crayon and wrote on the blackboard above her head  ann shirley has a very bad temper ann shirley must learn to control her temper and then read it out loud so that even the primer class who couldnt read writing should understand it  anne stood there the rest of the afternoon with that legend above her she did not cry or hang her head anger was still too hot in her heart for that and it sustained her amid all her agony of humiliation with resentful eyes and passion red cheeks she confronted alike dianas sympathetic gaze and charlie sloanes indignant nods and josie pyes malicious smiles as for gilbert blythe she would not even look at him she would never look at him again she would never speak to him  when school was dismissed anne marched out with her red head held high gilbert blythe tried to intercept her at the porch door  im awfully sorry i made fun of your hair anne he whispered contritely honest i am dont be mad for keeps now  anne swept by disdainfully without look or sign of hearing oh how could you anne breathed diana as they went down the road half reproachfully half admiringly diana felt that she could never have resisted gilberts plea  i shall never forgive gilbert blythe said anne firmly and mr phillips spelled my name without an e too the iron has entered into my soul diana  diana hadnt the least idea what anne meant but she understood it was something terrible  you mustnt mind gilbert making fun of your hair she said soothingly why he makes fun of all the girls he laughs at mine because its so black hes called me a crow a dozen times and i never heard him apologize for anything before either  theres a great deal of difference between being called a crow and being called carrots said anne with dignity gilbert blythe has hurt my feelings excruciatingly diana  it is possible the matter might have blown over without more excruciation if nothing else had happened but when things begin to happen they are apt to keep on  avonlea scholars often spent noon hour picking gum in mr bells spruce grove over the hill and across his big pasture field from there they could keep an eye on eben wrights house where the master boarded when they saw mr phillips emerging therefrom they ran for the schoolhouse but the distance being about three times longer than mr wrights lane they were very apt to arrive there breathless and gasping some three minutes too late  on the following day mr phillips was seized with one of his spasmodic fits of reform and announced before going home to dinner that he should expect to find all the scholars in their seats when he returned anyone who came in late would be punished  all the boys and some of the girls went to mr bells spruce grove as usual fully intending to stay only long enough to pick a chew but spruce groves are seductive and yellow nuts of gum beguiling they picked and loitered and strayed and as usual the first thing that recalled them to a sense of the flight of time was jimmy glover shouting from the top of a patriarchal old spruce masters coming  the girls who were on the ground started first and managed to reach the schoolhouse in time but without a second to spare the boys who had to wriggle hastily down from the trees were later and anne who had not been picking gum at all but was wandering happily in the far end of the grove waist deep among the bracken singing softly to herself with a wreath of rice lilies on her hair as if she were some wild divinity of the shadowy places was latest of all anne could run like a deer however run she did with the impish result that she overtook the boys at the door and was swept into the schoolhouse among them just as mr phillips was in the act of hanging up his hat  mr phillipss brief reforming energy was over he didnt want the bother of punishing a dozen pupils but it was necessary to do something to save his word so he looked about for a scapegoat and found it in anne who had dropped into her seat gasping for breath with a forgotten lily wreath hanging askew over one ear and giving her a particularly rakish and disheveled appearance  anne shirley since you seem to be so fond of the boys company we shall indulge your taste for it this afternoon he said sarcastically take those flowers out of your hair and sit with gilbert blythe  the other boys snickered diana turning pale with pity plucked the wreath from annes hair and squeezed her hand anne stared at the master as if turned to stone  did you hear what i said anne queried mr phillips sternly  yes sir said anne slowly but i didnt suppose you really meant it  i assure you i did still with the sarcastic inflection which all the children and anne especially hated it flicked on the raw obey me at once  for a moment anne looked as if she meant to disobey then realizing that there was no help for it she rose haughtily stepped across the aisle sat down beside gilbert blythe and buried her face in her arms on the desk ruby gillis who got a glimpse of it as it went down told the others going home from school that shed acksually never seen anything like it it was so white with awful little red spots in it  to anne this was as the end of all things it was bad enough to be singled out for punishment from among a dozen equally guilty ones it was worse still to be sent to sit with a boy but that that boy should be gilbert blythe was heaping insult on injury to a degree utterly unbearable anne felt that she could not bear it and it would be of no use to try her whole being seethed with shame and anger and humiliation  at first the other scholars looked and whispered and giggled and nudged but as anne never lifted her head and as gilbert worked fractions as if his whole soul was absorbed in them and them only they soon returned to their own tasks and anne was forgotten when mr phillips called the history class out anne should have gone but anne did not move and mr phillips who had been writing some verses to priscilla before he called the class was thinking about an obstinate rhyme still and never missed her once when nobody was looking gilbert took from his desk a little pink candy heart with a gold motto on it you are sweet and slipped it under the curve of annes arm whereupon anne arose took the pink heart gingerly between the tips of her fingers dropped it on the floor ground it to powder beneath her heel and resumed her position without deigning to bestow a glance on gilbert  when school went out anne marched to her desk ostentatiously took out everything therein books and writing tablet pen and ink testament and arithmetic and piled them neatly on her cracked slate  what are you taking all those things home for anne diana wanted to know as soon as they were out on the road she had not dared to ask the question before  i am not coming back to school any more said anne diana gasped and stared at anne to see if she meant it  will marilla let you stay home she asked  shell have to said anne ill never go to school to that man again  oh anne diana looked as if she were ready to cry i do think youre mean what shall i do mr phillips will make me sit with that horrid gertie pye i know he will because she is sitting alone do come back anne  id do almost anything in the world for you diana said anne sadly id let myself be torn limb from limb if it would do you any good but i cant do this so please dont ask it you harrow up my very soul  just think of all the fun you will miss mourned diana we are going to build the loveliest new house down by the brook and well be playing ball next week and youve never played ball anne its tremendously exciting and were going to learn a new song jane andrews is practicing it up now and alice andrews is going to bring a new pansy book next week and were all going to read it out loud chapter about down by the brook and you know you are so fond of reading out loud anne  nothing moved anne in the least her mind was made up she would not go to school to mr phillips again she told marilla so when she got home  nonsense said marilla  it isnt nonsense at all said anne gazing at marilla with solemn reproachful eyes dont you understand marilla ive been insulted  insulted fiddlesticks youll go to school tomorrow as usual  oh no anne shook her head gently im not going back marilla ill learn my lessons at home and ill be as good as i can be and hold my tongue all the time if its possible at all but i will not go back to school i assure you  marilla saw something remarkably like unyielding stubbornness looking out of annes small face she understood that she would have trouble in overcoming it but she resolved wisely to say nothing more just then  ill run down and see rachel about it this evening she thought theres no use reasoning with anne now shes too worked up and ive an idea she can be awful stubborn if she takes the notion far as i can make out from her story mr phillips has been carrying matters with a rather high hand but it would never do to say so to her ill just talk it over with rachel shes sent ten children to school and she ought to know something about it shell have heard the whole story too by this time  marilla found mrs lynde knitting quilts as industriously and cheerfully as usual  i suppose you know what ive come about she said a little shamefacedly  mrs rachel nodded  about annes fuss in school i reckon she said tillie boulter was in on her way home from school and told me about it  i dont know what to do with her said marilla she declares she wont go back to school i never saw a child so worked up ive been expecting trouble ever since she started to school i knew things were going too smooth to last shes so high strung what would you advise rachel  well since youve asked my advice marilla said mrs lynde amiably mrs lynde dearly loved to be asked for advice id just humor her a little at first thats what id do its my belief that mr phillips was in the wrong of course it doesnt do to say so to the children you know and of course he did right to punish her yesterday for giving way to temper but today it was different the others who were late should have been punished as well as anne thats what and i dont believe in making the girls sit with the boys for punishment it isnt modest tillie boulter was real indignant she took annes part right through and said all the scholars did too anne seems real popular among them somehow i never thought shed take with them so well  then you really think id better let her stay home said marilla in amazement  yes that is i wouldnt say school to her again until she said it herself depend upon it marilla shell cool off in a week or so and be ready enough to go back of her own accord thats what while if you were to make her go back right off dear knows what freak or tantrum shed take next and make more trouble than ever the less fuss made the better in my opinion she wont miss much by not going to school as far as that goes mr phillips isnt any good at all as a teacher the order he keeps is scandalous thats what and he neglects the young fry and puts all his time on those big scholars hes getting ready for queens hed never have got the school for another year if his uncle hadnt been a trustee the trustee for he just leads the other two around by the nose thats what i declare i dont know what education in this island is coming to  mrs rachel shook her head as much as to say if she were only at the head of the educational system of the province things would be much better managed  marilla took mrs rachels advice and not another word was said to anne about going back to school she learned her lessons at home did her chores and played with diana in the chilly purple autumn twilights but when she met gilbert blythe on the road or encountered him in sunday school she passed him by with an icy contempt that was no whit thawed by his evident desire to appease her even dianas efforts as a peacemaker were of no avail anne had evidently made up her mind to hate gilbert blythe to the end of life  as much as she hated gilbert however did she love diana with all the love of her passionate little heart equally intense in its likes and dislikes one evening marilla coming in from the orchard with a basket of apples found anne sitting along by the east window in the twilight crying bitterly  whatevers the matter now anne she asked  its about diana sobbed anne luxuriously i love diana so marilla i cannot ever live without her but i know very well when we grow up that diana will get married and go away and leave me and oh what shall i do i hate her husband i just hate him furiously ive been imagining it all out the wedding and everything diana dressed in snowy garments with a veil and looking as beautiful and regal as a queen and me the bridesmaid with a lovely dress too and puffed sleeves but with a breaking heart hid beneath my smiling face and then bidding diana goodbye e e  here anne broke down entirely and wept with increasing bitterness  marilla turned quickly away to hide her twitching face but it was no use she collapsed on the nearest chair and burst into such a hearty and unusual peal of laughter that matthew crossing the yard outside halted in amazement when had he heard marilla laugh like that before  well anne shirley said marilla as soon as she could speak if you must borrow trouble for pitys sake borrow it handier home i should think you had an imagination sure enough     chapter xvi diana is invited to tea with tragic results   october was a beautiful month at green gables when the birches in the hollow turned as golden as sunshine and the maples behind the orchard were royal crimson and the wild cherry trees along the lane put on the loveliest shades of dark red and bronzy green while the fields sunned themselves in aftermaths  anne reveled in the world of color about her  oh marilla she exclaimed one saturday morning coming dancing in with her arms full of gorgeous boughs im so glad i live in a world where there are octobers it would be terrible if we just skipped from september to november wouldnt it look at these maple branches dont they give you a thrill several thrills im going to decorate my room with them  messy things said marilla whose aesthetic sense was not noticeably developed you clutter up your room entirely too much with out of doors stuff anne bedrooms were made to sleep in  oh and dream in too marilla and you know one can dream so much better in a room where there are pretty things im going to put these boughs in the old blue jug and set them on my table  mind you dont drop leaves all over the stairs then im going on a meeting of the aid society at carmody this afternoon anne and i wont likely be home before dark youll have to get matthew and jerry their supper so mind you dont forget to put the tea to draw until you sit down at the table as you did last time  it was dreadful of me to forget said anne apologetically but that was the afternoon i was trying to think of a name for violet vale and it crowded other things out matthew was so good he never scolded a bit he put the tea down himself and said we could wait awhile as well as not and i told him a lovely fairy story while we were waiting so he didnt find the time long at all it was a beautiful fairy story marilla i forgot the end of it so i made up an end for it myself and matthew said he couldnt tell where the join came in  matthew would think it all right anne if you took a notion to get up and have dinner in the middle of the night but you keep your wits about you this time and i dont really know if im doing right it may make you more addlepated than ever but you can ask diana to come over and spend the afternoon with you and have tea here  oh marilla anne clasped her hands how perfectly lovely you are able to imagine things after all or else youd never have understood how ive longed for that very thing it will seem so nice and grown uppish no fear of my forgetting to put the tea to draw when i have company oh marilla can i use the rosebud spray tea set  no indeed the rosebud tea set well what next you know i never use that except for the minister or the aids youll put down the old brown tea set but you can open the little yellow crock of cherry preserves its time it was being used anyhow i believe its beginning to work and you can cut some fruit cake and have some of the cookies and snaps  i can just imagine myself sitting down at the head of the table and pouring out the tea said anne shutting her eyes ecstatically and asking diana if she takes sugar i know she doesnt but of course ill ask her just as if i didnt know and then pressing her to take another piece of fruit cake and another helping of preserves oh marilla its a wonderful sensation just to think of it can i take her into the spare room to lay off her hat when she comes and then into the parlor to sit  no the sitting room will do for you and your company but theres a bottle half full of raspberry cordial that was left over from the church social the other night its on the second shelf of the sitting room closet and you and diana can have it if you like and a cooky to eat with it along in the afternoon for i daresay matthew ‘ll be late coming in to tea since hes hauling potatoes to the vessel  anne flew down to the hollow past the dryads bubble and up the spruce path to orchard slope to ask diana to tea as a result just after marilla had driven off to carmody diana came over dressed in her second best dress and looking exactly as it is proper to look when asked out to tea at other times she was wont to run into the kitchen without knocking but now she knocked primly at the front door and when anne dressed in her second best as primly opened it both little girls shook hands as gravely as if they had never met before this unnatural solemnity lasted until after diana had been taken to the east gable to lay off her hat and then had sat for ten minutes in the sitting room toes in position  how is your mother inquired anne politely just as if she had not seen mrs barry picking apples that morning in excellent health and spirits  she is very well thank you i suppose mr cuthbert is hauling potatoes to the lily sands this afternoon is he said diana who had ridden down to mr harmon andrewss that morning in matthews cart  yes our potato crop is very good this year i hope your fathers crop is good too  it is fairly good thank you have you picked many of your apples yet  oh ever so many said anne forgetting to be dignified and jumping up quickly lets go out to the orchard and get some of the red sweetings diana marilla says we can have all that are left on the tree marilla is a very generous woman she said we could have fruit cake and cherry preserves for tea but it isnt good manners to tell your company what you are going to give them to eat so i wont tell you what she said we could have to drink only it begins with an r and a c and its bright red color i love bright red drinks dont you they taste twice as good as any other color  the orchard with its great sweeping boughs that bent to the ground with fruit proved so delightful that the little girls spent most of the afternoon in it sitting in a grassy corner where the frost had spared the green and the mellow autumn sunshine lingered warmly eating apples and talking as hard as they could diana had much to tell anne of what went on in school she had to sit with gertie pye and she hated it gertie squeaked her pencil all the time and it just made her dianas blood run cold ruby gillis had charmed all her warts away trues you live with a magic pebble that old mary joe from the creek gave her you had to rub the warts with the pebble and then throw it away over your left shoulder at the time of the new moon and the warts would all go charlie sloanes name was written up with em whites on the porch wall and em white was awful mad about it sam boulter had sassed mr phillips in class and mr phillips whipped him and sams father came down to the school and dared mr phillips to lay a hand on one of his children again and mattie andrews had a new red hood and a blue crossover with tassels on it and the airs she put on about it were perfectly sickening and lizzie wright didnt speak to mamie wilson because mamie wilsons grown up sister had cut out lizzie wrights grown up sister with her beau and everybody missed anne so and wished shes come to school again and gilbert blythe   but anne didnt want to hear about gilbert blythe she jumped up hurriedly and said suppose they go in and have some raspberry cordial  anne looked on the second shelf of the room pantry but there was no bottle of raspberry cordial there search revealed it away back on the top shelf anne put it on a tray and set it on the table with a tumbler  now please help yourself diana she said politely i dont believe ill have any just now i dont feel as if i wanted any after all those apples  diana poured herself out a tumblerful looked at its bright red hue admiringly and then sipped it daintily  thats awfully nice raspberry cordial anne she said i didnt know raspberry cordial was so nice  im real glad you like it take as much as you want im going to run out and stir the fire up there are so many responsibilities on a persons mind when theyre keeping house isnt there  when anne came back from the kitchen diana was drinking her second glassful of cordial and being entreated thereto by anne she offered no particular objection to the drinking of a third the tumblerfuls were generous ones and the raspberry cordial was certainly very nice  the nicest i ever drank said diana its ever so much nicer than mrs lyndes although she brags of hers so much it doesnt taste a bit like hers  i should think marillas raspberry cordial would probly be much nicer than mrs lyndes said anne loyally marilla is a famous cook she is trying to teach me to cook but i assure you diana it is uphill work theres so little scope for imagination in cookery you just have to go by rules the last time i made a cake i forgot to put the flour in i was thinking the loveliest story about you and me diana i thought you were desperately ill with smallpox and everybody deserted you but i went boldly to your bedside and nursed you back to life and then i took the smallpox and died and i was buried under those poplar trees in the graveyard and you planted a rosebush by my grave and watered it with your tears and you never never forgot the friend of your youth who sacrificed her life for you oh it was such a pathetic tale diana the tears just rained down over my cheeks while i mixed the cake but i forgot the flour and the cake was a dismal failure flour is so essential to cakes you know marilla was very cross and i dont wonder im a great trial to her she was terribly mortified about the pudding sauce last week we had a plum pudding for dinner on tuesday and there was half the pudding and a pitcherful of sauce left over marilla said there was enough for another dinner and told me to set it on the pantry shelf and cover it i meant to cover it just as much as could be diana but when i carried it in i was imagining i was a nun of course im a protestant but i imagined i was a catholic taking the veil to bury a broken heart in cloistered seclusion and i forgot all about covering the pudding sauce i thought of it next morning and ran to the pantry diana fancy if you can my extreme horror at finding a mouse drowned in that pudding sauce i lifted the mouse out with a spoon and threw it out in the yard and then i washed the spoon in three waters marilla was out milking and i fully intended to ask her when she came in if id give the sauce to the pigs but when she did come in i was imagining that i was a frost fairy going through the woods turning the trees red and yellow whichever they wanted to be so i never thought about the pudding sauce again and marilla sent me out to pick apples well mr and mrs chester ross from spencervale came here that morning you know they are very stylish people especially mrs chester ross when marilla called me in dinner was all ready and everybody was at the table i tried to be as polite and dignified as i could be for i wanted mrs chester ross to think i was a ladylike little girl even if i wasnt pretty everything went right until i saw marilla coming with the plum pudding in one hand and the pitcher of pudding sauce warmed up in the other diana that was a terrible moment i remembered everything and i just stood up in my place and shrieked out ‘marilla you mustnt use that pudding sauce there was a mouse drowned in it i forgot to tell you before oh diana i shall never forget that awful moment if i live to be a hundred mrs chester ross just looked at me and i thought i would sink through the floor with mortification she is such a perfect housekeeper and fancy what she must have thought of us marilla turned red as fire but she never said a word then she just carried that sauce and pudding out and brought in some strawberry preserves she even offered me some but i couldnt swallow a mouthful it was like heaping coals of fire on my head after mrs chester ross went away marilla gave me a dreadful scolding why diana what is the matter  diana had stood up very unsteadily then she sat down again putting her hands to her head  im im awful sick she said a little thickly i i must go right home  oh you mustnt dream of going home without your tea cried anne in distress ill get it right off ill go and put the tea down this very minute  i must go home repeated diana stupidly but determinedly  let me get you a lunch anyhow implored anne let me give you a bit of fruit cake and some of the cherry preserves lie down on the sofa for a little while and youll be better where do you feel bad  i must go home said diana and that was all she would say in vain anne pleaded  i never heard of company going home without tea she mourned oh diana do you suppose that its possible youre really taking the smallpox if you are ill go and nurse you you can depend on that ill never forsake you but i do wish youd stay till after tea where do you feel bad  im awful dizzy said diana  and indeed she walked very dizzily anne with tears of disappointment in her eyes got dianas hat and went with her as far as the barry yard fence then she wept all the way back to green gables where she sorrowfully put the remainder of the raspberry cordial back into the pantry and got tea ready for matthew and jerry with all the zest gone out of the performance  the next day was sunday and as the rain poured down in torrents from dawn till dusk anne did not stir abroad from green gables monday afternoon marilla sent her down to mrs lyndes on an errand in a very short space of time anne came flying back up the lane with tears rolling down her cheeks into the kitchen she dashed and flung herself face downward on the sofa in an agony  whatever has gone wrong now anne queried marilla in doubt and dismay i do hope you havent gone and been saucy to mrs lynde again  no answer from anne save more tears and stormier sobs  anne shirley when i ask you a question i want to be answered sit right up this very minute and tell me what you are crying about  anne sat up tragedy personified  mrs lynde was up to see mrs barry today and mrs barry was in an awful state she wailed she says that i set diana drunk saturday and sent her home in a disgraceful condition and she says i must be a thoroughly bad wicked little girl and shes never never going to let diana play with me again oh marilla im just overcome with woe  marilla stared in blank amazement  set diana drunk she said when she found her voice anne are you or mrs barry crazy what on earth did you give her  not a thing but raspberry cordial sobbed anne i never thought raspberry cordial would set people drunk marilla not even if they drank three big tumblerfuls as diana did oh it sounds so so like mrs thomass husband but i didnt mean to set her drunk  drunk fiddlesticks said marilla marching to the sitting room pantry there on the shelf was a bottle which she at once recognized as one containing some of her three year old homemade currant wine for which she was celebrated in avonlea although certain of the stricter sort mrs barry among them disapproved strongly of it and at the same time marilla recollected that she had put the bottle of raspberry cordial down in the cellar instead of in the pantry as she had told anne  she went back to the kitchen with the wine bottle in her hand her face was twitching in spite of herself  anne you certainly have a genius for getting into trouble you went and gave diana currant wine instead of raspberry cordial didnt you know the difference yourself  i never tasted it said anne i thought it was the cordial i meant to be so so hospitable diana got awfully sick and had to go home mrs barry told mrs lynde she was simply dead drunk she just laughed silly like when her mother asked her what was the matter and went to sleep and slept for hours her mother smelled her breath and knew she was drunk she had a fearful headache all day yesterday mrs barry is so indignant she will never believe but what i did it on purpose  i should think she would better punish diana for being so greedy as to drink three glassfuls of anything said marilla shortly why three of those big glasses would have made her sick even if it had only been cordial well this story will be a nice handle for those folks who are so down on me for making currant wine although i havent made any for three years ever since i found out that the minister didnt approve i just kept that bottle for sickness there there child dont cry i cant see as you were to blame although im sorry it happened so  i must cry said anne my heart is broken the stars in their courses fight against me marilla diana and i are parted forever oh marilla i little dreamed of this when first we swore our vows of friendship  dont be foolish anne mrs barry will think better of it when she finds youre not to blame i suppose she thinks youve done it for a silly joke or something of that sort youd best go up this evening and tell her how it was  my courage fails me at the thought of facing dianas injured mother  sighed anne i wish youd go marilla youre so much more dignified than i am likely shed listen to you quicker than to me  well i will said marilla reflecting that it would probably be the wiser course dont cry any more anne it will be all right  marilla had changed her mind about it being all right by the time she got back from orchard slope anne was watching for her coming and flew to the porch door to meet her  oh marilla i know by your face that its been no use she said sorrowfully mrs barry wont forgive me  mrs barry indeed snapped marilla of all the unreasonable women i ever saw shes the worst i told her it was all a mistake and you werent to blame but she just simply didnt believe me and she rubbed it well in about my currant wine and how id always said it couldnt have the least effect on anybody i just told her plainly that currant wine wasnt meant to be drunk three tumblerfuls at a time and that if a child i had to do with was so greedy id sober her up with a right good spanking  marilla whisked into the kitchen grievously disturbed leaving a very much distracted little soul in the porch behind her presently anne stepped out bareheaded into the chill autumn dusk very determinedly and steadily she took her way down through the sere clover field over the log bridge and up through the spruce grove lighted by a pale little moon hanging low over the western woods mrs barry coming to the door in answer to a timid knock found a white lipped eager eyed suppliant on the doorstep  her face hardened mrs barry was a woman of strong prejudices and dislikes and her anger was of the cold sullen sort which is always hardest to overcome to do her justice she really believed anne had made diana drunk out of sheer malice prepense and she was honestly anxious to preserve her little daughter from the contamination of further intimacy with such a child  what do you want she said stiffly  anne clasped her hands  oh mrs barry please forgive me i did not mean to to intoxicate diana how could i just imagine if you were a poor little orphan girl that kind people had adopted and you had just one bosom friend in all the world do you think you would intoxicate her on purpose i thought it was only raspberry cordial i was firmly convinced it was raspberry cordial oh please dont say that you wont let diana play with me any more if you do you will cover my life with a dark cloud of woe  this speech which would have softened good mrs lyndes heart in a twinkling had no effect on mrs barry except to irritate her still more she was suspicious of annes big words and dramatic gestures and imagined that the child was making fun of her so she said coldly and cruelly   i dont think you are a fit little girl for diana to associate with youd better go home and behave yourself  annes lips quivered  wont you let me see diana just once to say farewell she implored  diana has gone over to carmody with her father said mrs barry going in and shutting the door  anne went back to green gables calm with despair  my last hope is gone she told marilla i went up and saw mrs barry myself and she treated me very insultingly marilla i do not think she is a well bred woman there is nothing more to do except to pray and i havent much hope that thatll do much good because marilla i do not believe that god himself can do very much with such an obstinate person as mrs barry  anne you shouldnt say such things rebuked marilla striving to overcome that unholy tendency to laughter which she was dismayed to find growing upon her and indeed when she told the whole story to matthew that night she did laugh heartily over annes tribulations  but when she slipped into the east gable before going to bed and found that anne had cried herself to sleep an unaccustomed softness crept into her face  poor little soul she murmured lifting a loose curl of hair from the childs tear stained face then she bent down and kissed the flushed cheek on the pillow     chapter xvii a new interest in life   the next afternoon anne bending over her patchwork at the kitchen window happened to glance out and beheld diana down by the dryads bubble beckoning mysteriously in a trice anne was out of the house and flying down to the hollow astonishment and hope struggling in her expressive eyes but the hope faded when she saw dianas dejected countenance  your mother hasnt relented she gasped  diana shook her head mournfully  no and oh anne she says im never to play with you again ive cried and cried and i told her it wasnt your fault but it wasnt any use i had ever such a time coaxing her to let me come down and say good bye to you she said i was only to stay ten minutes and shes timing me by the clock  ten minutes isnt very long to say an eternal farewell in said anne tearfully oh diana will you promise faithfully never to forget me the friend of your youth no matter what dearer friends may caress thee  indeed i will sobbed diana and ill never have another bosom friend i dont want to have i couldnt love anybody as i love you  oh diana cried anne clasping her hands do you love me  why of course i do didnt you know that  no anne drew a long breath i thought you liked me of course but i never hoped you loved me why diana i didnt think anybody could love me nobody ever has loved me since i can remember oh this is wonderful its a ray of light which will forever shine on the darkness of a path severed from thee diana oh just say it once again  i love you devotedly anne said diana stanchly and i always will you may be sure of that  and i will always love thee diana said anne solemnly extending her hand in the years to come thy memory will shine like a star over my lonely life as that last story we read together says diana wilt thou give me a lock of thy jet black tresses in parting to treasure forevermore  have you got anything to cut it with queried diana wiping away the tears which annes affecting accents had caused to flow afresh and returning to practicalities  yes ive got my patchwork scissors in my apron pocket fortunately  said anne she solemnly clipped one of dianas curls fare thee well my beloved friend henceforth we must be as strangers though living side by side but my heart will ever be faithful to thee  anne stood and watched diana out of sight mournfully waving her hand to the latter whenever she turned to look back then she returned to the house not a little consoled for the time being by this romantic parting  it is all over she informed marilla i shall never have another friend im really worse off than ever before for i havent katie maurice and violetta now and even if i had it wouldnt be the same somehow little dream girls are not satisfying after a real friend diana and i had such an affecting farewell down by the spring it will be sacred in my memory forever i used the most pathetic language i could think of and said ‘thou and ‘thee ‘thou and ‘thee seem so much more romantic than ‘you diana gave me a lock of her hair and im going to sew it up in a little bag and wear it around my neck all my life please see that it is buried with me for i dont believe ill live very long perhaps when she sees me lying cold and dead before her mrs barry may feel remorse for what she has done and will let diana come to my funeral  i dont think there is much fear of your dying of grief as long as you can talk anne said marilla unsympathetically  the following monday anne surprised marilla by coming down from her room with her basket of books on her arm and hip and her lips primmed up into a line of determination  im going back to school she announced that is all there is left in life for me now that my friend has been ruthlessly torn from me in school i can look at her and muse over days departed  youd better muse over your lessons and sums said marilla concealing her delight at this development of the situation if youre going back to school i hope well hear no more of breaking slates over peoples heads and such carryings on behave yourself and do just what your teacher tells you  ill try to be a model pupil agreed anne dolefully there wont be much fun in it i expect mr phillips said minnie andrews was a model pupil and there isnt a spark of imagination or life in her she is just dull and poky and never seems to have a good time but i feel so depressed that perhaps it will come easy to me now im going round by the road i couldnt bear to go by the birch path all alone i should weep bitter tears if i did  anne was welcomed back to school with open arms her imagination had been sorely missed in games her voice in the singing and her dramatic ability in the perusal aloud of books at dinner hour ruby gillis smuggled three blue plums over to her during testament reading ella may macpherson gave her an enormous yellow pansy cut from the covers of a floral catalogue a species of desk decoration much prized in avonlea school sophia sloane offered to teach her a perfectly elegant new pattern of knit lace so nice for trimming aprons katie boulter gave her a perfume bottle to keep slate water in and julia bell copied carefully on a piece of pale pink paper scalloped on the edges the following effusion                   to anne    when twilight drops her curtain down   and pins it with a star   remember that you have a friend   though she may wander far   its so nice to be appreciated sighed anne rapturously to marilla that night  the girls were not the only scholars who appreciated her when anne went to her seat after dinner hour she had been told by mr phillips to sit with the model minnie andrews she found on her desk a big luscious strawberry apple anne caught it up all ready to take a bite when she remembered that the only place in avonlea where strawberry apples grew was in the old blythe orchard on the other side of the lake of shining waters anne dropped the apple as if it were a red hot coal and ostentatiously wiped her fingers on her handkerchief the apple lay untouched on her desk until the next morning when little timothy andrews who swept the school and kindled the fire annexed it as one of his perquisites charlie sloanes slate pencil gorgeously bedizened with striped red and yellow paper costing two cents where ordinary pencils cost only one which he sent up to her after dinner hour met with a more favorable reception anne was graciously pleased to accept it and rewarded the donor with a smile which exalted that infatuated youth straightway into the seventh heaven of delight and caused him to make such fearful errors in his dictation that mr phillips kept him in after school to rewrite it  but as    the cæsars pageant shorn of brutus bust   did but of romes best son remind her more  so the marked absence of any tribute or recognition from diana barry who was sitting with gertie pye embittered annes little triumph  diana might just have smiled at me once i think she mourned to marilla that night but the next morning a note most fearfully and wonderfully twisted and folded and a small parcel were passed across to anne     dear anne ran the former mother says im not to play with you or    talk to you even in school it isnt my fault and dont be cross at    me because i love you as much as ever i miss you awfully to tell    all my secrets to and i dont like gertie pye one bit i made you    one of the new bookmarkers out of red tissue paper they are awfully    fashionable now and only three girls in school know how to make    them when you look at it remember                                                        your true friend                                                            diana barry  anne read the note kissed the bookmark and dispatched a prompt reply back to the other side of the school    my own darling diana      of course i am not cross at you because you have to obey your   mother our spirits can commune i shall keep your lovely present   forever minnie andrews is a very nice little girl although she   has no imagination but after having been dianas busum friend i   cannot be minnies please excuse mistakes because my spelling   isnt very good yet although much improoved                                             yours until death us do part                                               anne or cordelia shirley     ps i shall sleep with your letter under my pillow tonight                                                             a or cs  marilla pessimistically expected more trouble since anne had again begun to go to school but none developed perhaps anne caught something of the model spirit from minnie andrews at least she got on very well with mr phillips thenceforth she flung herself into her studies heart and soul determined not to be outdone in any class by gilbert blythe the rivalry between them was soon apparent it was entirely good natured on gilberts side but it is much to be feared that the same thing cannot be said of anne who had certainly an unpraiseworthy tenacity for holding grudges she was as intense in her hatreds as in her loves she would not stoop to admit that she meant to rival gilbert in schoolwork because that would have been to acknowledge his existence which anne persistently ignored but the rivalry was there and honors fluctuated between them now gilbert was head of the spelling class now anne with a toss of her long red braids spelled him down one morning gilbert had all his sums done correctly and had his name written on the blackboard on the roll of honor the next morning anne having wrestled wildly with decimals the entire evening before would be first one awful day they were ties and their names were written up together it was almost as bad as a take notice and annes mortification was as evident as gilberts satisfaction when the written examinations at the end of each month were held the suspense was terrible the first month gilbert came out three marks ahead the second anne beat him by five but her triumph was marred by the fact that gilbert congratulated her heartily before the whole school it would have been ever so much sweeter to her if he had felt the sting of his defeat  mr phillips might not be a very good teacher but a pupil so inflexibly determined on learning as anne was could hardly escape making progress under any kind of teacher by the end of the term anne and gilbert were both promoted into the fifth class and allowed to begin studying the elements of the branches by which latin geometry french and algebra were meant in geometry anne met her waterloo  its perfectly awful stuff marilla she groaned im sure ill never be able to make head or tail of it there is no scope for imagination in it at all mr phillips says im the worst dunce he ever saw at it and gil i mean some of the others are so smart at it it is extremely mortifying marilla  even diana gets along better than i do but i dont mind being beaten by diana even although we meet as strangers now i still love her with an inextinguishable love it makes me very sad at times to think about her but really marilla one cant stay sad very long in such an interesting world can one     chapter xviii anne to the rescue   all things great are wound up with all things little at first glance it might not seem that the decision of a certain canadian premier to include prince edward island in a political tour could have much or anything to do with the fortunes of little anne shirley at green gables but it had  it was a january the premier came to address his loyal supporters and such of his nonsupporters as chose to be present at the monster mass meeting held in charlottetown most of the avonlea people were on premiers side of politics hence on the night of the meeting nearly all the men and a goodly proportion of the women had gone to town thirty miles away mrs rachel lynde had gone too mrs rachel lynde was a red hot politician and couldnt have believed that the political rally could be carried through without her although she was on the opposite side of politics so she went to town and took her husband thomas would be useful in looking after the horse and marilla cuthbert with her marilla had a sneaking interest in politics herself and as she thought it might be her only chance to see a real live premier she promptly took it leaving anne and matthew to keep house until her return the following day  hence while marilla and mrs rachel were enjoying themselves hugely at the mass meeting anne and matthew had the cheerful kitchen at green gables all to themselves a bright fire was glowing in the old fashioned waterloo stove and blue white frost crystals were shining on the windowpanes matthew nodded over a farmers advocate on the sofa and anne at the table studied her lessons with grim determination despite sundry wistful glances at the clock shelf where lay a new book that jane andrews had lent her that day jane had assured her that it was warranted to produce any number of thrills or words to that effect and annes fingers tingled to reach out for it but that would mean gilbert blythes triumph on the morrow anne turned her back on the clock shelf and tried to imagine it wasnt there  matthew did you ever study geometry when you went to school  well now no i didnt said matthew coming out of his doze with a start  i wish you had sighed anne because then youd be able to sympathize with me you cant sympathize properly if youve never studied it it is casting a cloud over my whole life im such a dunce at it matthew  well now i dunno said matthew soothingly i guess youre all right at anything mr phillips told me last week in blairs store at carmody that you was the smartest scholar in school and was making rapid progress ‘rapid progress was his very words theres them as runs down teddy phillips and says he aint much of a teacher but i guess hes all right  matthew would have thought anyone who praised anne was all right  im sure id get on better with geometry if only he wouldnt change the letters complained anne i learn the proposition off by heart and then he draws it on the blackboard and puts different letters from what are in the book and i get all mixed up i dont think a teacher should take such a mean advantage do you were studying agriculture now and ive found out at last what makes the roads red its a great comfort i wonder how marilla and mrs lynde are enjoying themselves mrs lynde says canada is going to the dogs the way things are being run at ottawa and that its an awful warning to the electors she says if women were allowed to vote we would soon see a blessed change what way do you vote matthew  conservative said matthew promptly to vote conservative was part of matthews religion  then im conservative too said anne decidedly im glad because gil because some of the boys in school are grits i guess mr phillips is a grit too because prissy andrewss father is one and ruby gillis says that when a man is courting he always has to agree with the girls mother in religion and her father in politics is that true matthew  well now i dunno said matthew  did you ever go courting matthew  well now no i dunnos i ever did said matthew who had certainly never thought of such a thing in his whole existence  anne reflected with her chin in her hands  it must be rather interesting dont you think matthew ruby gillis says when she grows up shes going to have ever so many beaus on the string and have them all crazy about her but i think that would be too exciting id rather have just one in his right mind but ruby gillis knows a great deal about such matters because she has so many big sisters and mrs lynde says the gillis girls have gone off like hot cakes mr phillips goes up to see prissy andrews nearly every evening he says it is to help her with her lessons but miranda sloane is studying for queens too and i should think she needed help a lot more than prissy because shes ever so much stupider but he never goes to help her in the evenings at all there are a great many things in this world that i cant understand very well matthew  well now i dunno as i comprehend them all myself acknowledged matthew  well i suppose i must finish up my lessons i wont allow myself to open that new book jane lent me until im through but its a terrible temptation matthew even when i turn my back on it i can see it there just as plain jane said she cried herself sick over it i love a book that makes me cry but i think ill carry that book into the sitting room and lock it in the jam closet and give you the key and you must not give it to me matthew until my lessons are done not even if i implore you on my bended knees its all very well to say resist temptation but its ever so much easier to resist it if you cant get the key and then shall i run down the cellar and get some russets matthew wouldnt you like some russets  well now i dunno but what i would said matthew who never ate russets but knew annes weakness for them  just as anne emerged triumphantly from the cellar with her plateful of russets came the sound of flying footsteps on the icy board walk outside and the next moment the kitchen door was flung open and in rushed diana barry white faced and breathless with a shawl wrapped hastily around her head anne promptly let go of her candle and plate in her surprise and plate candle and apples crashed together down the cellar ladder and were found at the bottom embedded in melted grease the next day by marilla who gathered them up and thanked mercy the house hadnt been set on fire  whatever is the matter diana cried anne has your mother relented at last  oh anne do come quick implored diana nervously minnie may is awful sick shes got croup young mary joe says and father and mother are away to town and theres nobody to go for the doctor minnie may is awful bad and young mary joe doesnt know what to do and oh anne im so scared  matthew without a word reached out for cap and coat slipped past diana and away into the darkness of the yard  hes gone to harness the sorrel mare to go to carmody for the doctor  said anne who was hurrying on hood and jacket i know it as well as if hed said so matthew and i are such kindred spirits i can read his thoughts without words at all  i dont believe hell find the doctor at carmody sobbed diana i know that dr blair went to town and i guess dr spencer would go too young mary joe never saw anybody with croup and mrs lynde is away oh anne  dont cry di said anne cheerily i know exactly what to do for croup you forget that mrs hammond had twins three times when you look after three pairs of twins you naturally get a lot of experience they all had croup regularly just wait till i get the ipecac bottle you maynt have any at your house come on now  the two little girls hastened out hand in hand and hurried through lovers lane and across the crusted field beyond for the snow was too deep to go by the shorter wood way anne although sincerely sorry for minnie may was far from being insensible to the romance of the situation and to the sweetness of once more sharing that romance with a kindred spirit  the night was clear and frosty all ebony of shadow and silver of snowy slope big stars were shining over the silent fields here and there the dark pointed firs stood up with snow powdering their branches and the wind whistling through them anne thought it was truly delightful to go skimming through all this mystery and loveliness with your bosom friend who had been so long estranged  minnie may aged three was really very sick she lay on the kitchen sofa feverish and restless while her hoarse breathing could be heard all over the house young mary joe a buxom broad faced french girl from the creek whom mrs barry had engaged to stay with the children during her absence was helpless and bewildered quite incapable of thinking what to do or doing it if she thought of it  anne went to work with skill and promptness  minnie may has croup all right shes pretty bad but ive seen them worse first we must have lots of hot water i declare diana there isnt more than a cupful in the kettle there ive filled it up and mary joe you may put some wood in the stove i dont want to hurt your feelings but it seems to me you might have thought of this before if youd any imagination now ill undress minnie may and put her to bed and you try to find some soft flannel cloths diana im going to give her a dose of ipecac first of all  minnie may did not take kindly to the ipecac but anne had not brought up three pairs of twins for nothing down that ipecac went not only once but many times during the long anxious night when the two little girls worked patiently over the suffering minnie may and young mary joe honestly anxious to do all she could kept up a roaring fire and heated more water than would have been needed for a hospital of croupy babies  it was three oclock when matthew came with a doctor for he had been obliged to go all the way to spencervale for one but the pressing need for assistance was past minnie may was much better and was sleeping soundly  i was awfully near giving up in despair explained anne she got worse and worse until she was sicker than ever the hammond twins were even the last pair i actually thought she was going to choke to death i gave her every drop of ipecac in that bottle and when the last dose went down i said to myself not to diana or young mary joe because i didnt want to worry them any more than they were worried but i had to say it to myself just to relieve my feelings ‘this is the last lingering hope and i fear tis a vain one but in about three minutes she coughed up the phlegm and began to get better right away you must just imagine my relief doctor because i cant express it in words you know there are some things that cannot be expressed in words  yes i know nodded the doctor he looked at anne as if he were thinking some things about her that couldnt be expressed in words later on however he expressed them to mr and mrs barry  that little redheaded girl they have over at cuthberts is as smart as they make ‘em i tell you she saved that babys life for it would have been too late by the time i got there she seems to have a skill and presence of mind perfectly wonderful in a child of her age i never saw anything like the eyes of her when she was explaining the case to me  anne had gone home in the wonderful white frosted winter morning heavy eyed from loss of sleep but still talking unweariedly to matthew as they crossed the long white field and walked under the glittering fairy arch of the lovers lane maples  oh matthew isnt it a wonderful morning the world looks like something god had just imagined for his own pleasure doesnt it those trees look as if i could blow them away with a breath pouf im so glad i live in a world where there are white frosts arent you and im so glad mrs hammond had three pairs of twins after all if she hadnt i mightnt have known what to do for minnie may im real sorry i was ever cross with mrs hammond for having twins but oh matthew im so sleepy i cant go to school i just know i couldnt keep my eyes open and id be so stupid but i hate to stay home for gil some of the others will get head of the class and its so hard to get up again although of course the harder it is the more satisfaction you have when you do get up havent you  well now i guess youll manage all right said matthew looking at annes white little face and the dark shadows under her eyes you just go right to bed and have a good sleep ill do all the chores  anne accordingly went to bed and slept so long and soundly that it was well on in the white and rosy winter afternoon when she awoke and descended to the kitchen where marilla who had arrived home in the meantime was sitting knitting  oh did you see the premier exclaimed anne at once what did he look like marilla  well he never got to be premier on account of his looks said marilla such a nose as that man had but he can speak i was proud of being a conservative rachel lynde of course being a liberal had no use for him your dinner is in the oven anne and you can get yourself some blue plum preserve out of the pantry i guess youre hungry matthew has been telling me about last night i must say it was fortunate you knew what to do i wouldnt have had any idea myself for i never saw a case of croup there now never mind talking till youve had your dinner i can tell by the look of you that youre just full up with speeches but theyll keep  marilla had something to tell anne but she did not tell it just then for she knew if she did annes consequent excitement would lift her clear out of the region of such material matters as appetite or dinner not until anne had finished her saucer of blue plums did marilla say   mrs barry was here this afternoon anne she wanted to see you but i wouldnt wake you up she says you saved minnie mays life and she is very sorry she acted as she did in that affair of the currant wine she says she knows now you didnt mean to set diana drunk and she hopes youll forgive her and be good friends with diana again youre to go over this evening if you like for diana cant stir outside the door on account of a bad cold she caught last night now anne shirley for pitys sake dont fly up into the air  the warning seemed not unnecessary so uplifted and aerial was annes expression and attitude as she sprang to her feet her face irradiated with the flame of her spirit  oh marilla can i go right now without washing my dishes ill wash them when i come back but i cannot tie myself down to anything so unromantic as dishwashing at this thrilling moment  yes yes run along said marilla indulgently anne shirley are you crazy come back this instant and put something on you i might as well call to the wind shes gone without a cap or wrap look at her tearing through the orchard with her hair streaming itll be a mercy if she doesnt catch her death of cold  anne came dancing home in the purple winter twilight across the snowy places afar in the southwest was the great shimmering pearl like sparkle of an evening star in a sky that was pale golden and ethereal rose over gleaming white spaces and dark glens of spruce the tinkles of sleigh bells among the snowy hills came like elfin chimes through the frosty air but their music was not sweeter than the song in annes heart and on her lips  you see before you a perfectly happy person marilla she announced im perfectly happy yes in spite of my red hair just at present i have a soul above red hair mrs barry kissed me and cried and said she was so sorry and she could never repay me i felt fearfully embarrassed marilla but i just said as politely as i could ‘i have no hard feelings for you mrs barry i assure you once for all that i did not mean to intoxicate diana and henceforth i shall cover the past with the mantle of oblivion that was a pretty dignified way of speaking wasnt it marilla  i felt that i was heaping coals of fire on mrs barrys head and diana and i had a lovely afternoon diana showed me a new fancy crochet stitch her aunt over at carmody taught her not a soul in avonlea knows it but us and we pledged a solemn vow never to reveal it to anyone else diana gave me a beautiful card with a wreath of roses on it and a verse of poetry         if you love me as i love you       nothing but death can part us two  and that is true marilla were going to ask mr phillips to let us sit together in school again and gertie pye can go with minnie andrews we had an elegant tea mrs barry had the very best china set out marilla just as if i was real company i cant tell you what a thrill it gave me nobody ever used their very best china on my account before and we had fruit cake and pound cake and doughnuts and two kinds of preserves marilla and mrs barry asked me if i took tea and said ‘pa why dont you pass the biscuits to anne it must be lovely to be grown up marilla when just being treated as if you were is so nice  i dont know about that said marilla with a brief sigh  well anyway when i am grown up said anne decidedly im always going to talk to little girls as if they were too and ill never laugh when they use big words i know from sorrowful experience how that hurts ones feelings after tea diana and i made taffy the taffy wasnt very good i suppose because neither diana nor i had ever made any before diana left me to stir it while she buttered the plates and i forgot and let it burn and then when we set it out on the platform to cool the cat walked over one plate and that had to be thrown away but the making of it was splendid fun then when i came home mrs barry asked me to come over as often as i could and diana stood at the window and threw kisses to me all the way down to lovers lane i assure you marilla that i feel like praying tonight and im going to think out a special brand new prayer in honor of the occasion     chapter xix a concert a catastrophe and a confession   marilla can i go over to see diana just for a minute asked anne running breathlessly down from the east gable one february evening  i dont see what you want to be traipsing about after dark for said marilla shortly you and diana walked home from school together and then stood down there in the snow for half an hour more your tongues going the whole blessed time clickety clack so i dont think youre very badly off to see her again  but she wants to see me pleaded anne she has something very important to tell me  how do you know she has  because she just signaled to me from her window we have arranged a way to signal with our candles and cardboard we set the candle on the window sill and make flashes by passing the cardboard back and forth so many flashes mean a certain thing it was my idea marilla  ill warrant you it was said marilla emphatically and the next thing youll be setting fire to the curtains with your signaling nonsense  oh were very careful marilla and its so interesting two flashes mean ‘are you there three mean ‘yes and four ‘no five mean ‘come over as soon as possible because i have something important to reveal diana has just signaled five flashes and im really suffering to know what it is  well you neednt suffer any longer said marilla sarcastically you can go but youre to be back here in just ten minutes remember that  anne did remember it and was back in the stipulated time although probably no mortal will ever know just what it cost her to confine the discussion of dianas important communication within the limits of ten minutes but at least she had made good use of them  oh marilla what do you think you know tomorrow is dianas birthday well her mother told her she could ask me to go home with her from school and stay all night with her and her cousins are coming over from newbridge in a big pung sleigh to go to the debating club concert at the hall tomorrow night and they are going to take diana and me to the concert if youll let me go that is you will wont you marilla oh i feel so excited  you can calm down then because youre not going youre better at home in your own bed and as for that club concert its all nonsense and little girls should not be allowed to go out to such places at all  im sure the debating club is a most respectable affair pleaded anne  im not saying it isnt but youre not going to begin gadding about to concerts and staying out all hours of the night pretty doings for children im surprised at mrs barrys letting diana go  but its such a very special occasion mourned anne on the verge of tears diana has only one birthday in a year it isnt as if birthdays were common things marilla prissy andrews is going to recite ‘curfew must not ring tonight that is such a good moral piece marilla im sure it would do me lots of good to hear it and the choir are going to sing four lovely pathetic songs that are pretty near as good as hymns and oh marilla the minister is going to take part yes indeed he is hes going to give an address that will be just about the same thing as a sermon please maynt i go marilla  you heard what i said anne didnt you take off your boots now and go to bed its past eight  theres just one more thing marilla said anne with the air of producing the last shot in her locker mrs barry told diana that we might sleep in the spare room bed think of the honor of your little anne being put in the spare room bed  its an honor youll have to get along without go to bed anne and dont let me hear another word out of you  when anne with tears rolling over her cheeks had gone sorrowfully upstairs matthew who had been apparently sound asleep on the lounge during the whole dialogue opened his eyes and said decidedly   well now marilla i think you ought to let anne go  i dont then retorted marilla whos bringing this child up matthew you or me  well now you admitted matthew  dont interfere then  well now i aint interfering it aint interfering to have your own opinion and my opinion is that you ought to let anne go  youd think i ought to let anne go to the moon if she took the notion ive no doubt was marillas amiable rejoinder i might have let her spend the night with diana if that was all but i dont approve of this concert plan shed go there and catch cold like as not and have her head filled up with nonsense and excitement it would unsettle her for a week i understand that childs disposition and whats good for it better than you matthew  i think you ought to let anne go repeated matthew firmly argument was not his strong point but holding fast to his opinion certainly was marilla gave a gasp of helplessness and took refuge in silence the next morning when anne was washing the breakfast dishes in the pantry matthew paused on his way out to the barn to say to marilla again   i think you ought to let anne go marilla  for a moment marilla looked things not lawful to be uttered then she yielded to the inevitable and said tartly   very well she can go since nothing else ‘ll please you  anne flew out of the pantry dripping dishcloth in hand  oh marilla marilla say those blessed words again  i guess once is enough to say them this is matthews doings and i wash my hands of it if you catch pneumonia sleeping in a strange bed or coming out of that hot hall in the middle of the night dont blame me blame matthew anne shirley youre dripping greasy water all over the floor i never saw such a careless child  oh i know im a great trial to you marilla said anne repentantly i make so many mistakes but then just think of all the mistakes i dont make although i might ill get some sand and scrub up the spots before i go to school oh marilla my heart was just set on going to that concert i never was to a concert in my life and when the other girls talk about them in school i feel so out of it you didnt know just how i felt about it but you see matthew did matthew understands me and its so nice to be understood marilla  anne was too excited to do herself justice as to lessons that morning in school gilbert blythe spelled her down in class and left her clear out of sight in mental arithmetic annes consequent humiliation was less than it might have been however in view of the concert and the spare room bed she and diana talked so constantly about it all day that with a stricter teacher than mr phillips dire disgrace must inevitably have been their portion  anne felt that she could not have borne it if she had not been going to the concert for nothing else was discussed that day in school the avonlea debating club which met fortnightly all winter had had several smaller free entertainments but this was to be a big affair admission ten cents in aid of the library the avonlea young people had been practicing for weeks and all the scholars were especially interested in it by reason of older brothers and sisters who were going to take part everybody in school over nine years of age expected to go except carrie sloane whose father shared marillas opinions about small girls going out to night concerts carrie sloane cried into her grammar all the afternoon and felt that life was not worth living  for anne the real excitement began with the dismissal of school and increased therefrom in crescendo until it reached to a crash of positive ecstasy in the concert itself they had a perfectly elegant tea and then came the delicious occupation of dressing in dianas little room upstairs diana did annes front hair in the new pompadour style and anne tied dianas bows with the especial knack she possessed and they experimented with at least half a dozen different ways of arranging their back hair at last they were ready cheeks scarlet and eyes glowing with excitement  true anne could not help a little pang when she contrasted her plain black tam and shapeless tight sleeved homemade gray cloth coat with dianas jaunty fur cap and smart little jacket but she remembered in time that she had an imagination and could use it  then dianas cousins the murrays from newbridge came they all crowded into the big pung sleigh among straw and furry robes anne reveled in the drive to the hall slipping along over the satin smooth roads with the snow crisping under the runners there was a magnificent sunset and the snowy hills and deep blue water of the st lawrence gulf seemed to rim in the splendor like a huge bowl of pearl and sapphire brimmed with wine and fire tinkles of sleigh bells and distant laughter that seemed like the mirth of wood elves came from every quarter  oh diana breathed anne squeezing dianas mittened hand under the fur robe isnt it all like a beautiful dream do i really look the same as usual i feel so different that it seems to me it must show in my looks  you look awfully nice said diana who having just received a compliment from one of her cousins felt that she ought to pass it on youve got the loveliest color  the program that night was a series of thrills for at least one listener in the audience and as anne assured diana every succeeding thrill was thrillier than the last when prissy andrews attired in a new pink silk waist with a string of pearls about her smooth white throat and real carnations in her hair rumor whispered that the master had sent all the way to town for them for her climbed the slimy ladder dark without one ray of light anne shivered in luxurious sympathy when the choir sang far above the gentle daisies anne gazed at the ceiling as if it were frescoed with angels when sam sloane proceeded to explain and illustrate how sockery set a hen anne laughed until people sitting near her laughed too more out of sympathy with her than with amusement at a selection that was rather threadbare even in avonlea and when mr phillips gave mark antonys oration over the dead body of cæsar in the most heart stirring tones looking at prissy andrews at the end of every sentence anne felt that she could rise and mutiny on the spot if but one roman citizen led the way  only one number on the program failed to interest her when gilbert blythe recited bingen on the rhine anne picked up rhoda murrays library book and read it until he had finished when she sat rigidly stiff and motionless while diana clapped her hands until they tingled  it was eleven when they got home sated with dissipation but with the exceeding sweet pleasure of talking it all over still to come everybody seemed asleep and the house was dark and silent anne and diana tiptoed into the parlor a long narrow room out of which the spare room opened it was pleasantly warm and dimly lighted by the embers of a fire in the grate  lets undress here said diana its so nice and warm  hasnt it been a delightful time sighed anne rapturously it must be splendid to get up and recite there do you suppose we will ever be asked to do it diana  yes of course someday theyre always wanting the big scholars to recite gilbert blythe does often and hes only two years older than us oh anne how could you pretend not to listen to him when he came to the line             ‘theres another not a sister  he looked right down at you  diana said anne with dignity you are my bosom friend but i cannot allow even you to speak to me of that person are you ready for bed lets run a race and see wholl get to the bed first  the suggestion appealed to diana the two little white clad figures flew down the long room through the spare room door and bounded on the bed at the same moment and then something moved beneath them there was a gasp and a cry and somebody said in muffled accents   merciful goodness  anne and diana were never able to tell just how they got off that bed and out of the room they only knew that after one frantic rush they found themselves tiptoeing shiveringly upstairs  oh who was it what was it whispered anne her teeth chattering with cold and fright  it was aunt josephine said diana gasping with laughter oh anne it was aunt josephine however she came to be there oh and i know she will be furious its dreadful its really dreadful but did you ever know anything so funny anne  who is your aunt josephine  shes fathers aunt and she lives in charlottetown shes awfully old seventy anyhow and i dont believe she was ever a little girl we were expecting her out for a visit but not so soon shes awfully prim and proper and shell scold dreadfully about this i know well well have to sleep with minnie may and you cant think how she kicks  miss josephine barry did not appear at the early breakfast the next morning mrs barry smiled kindly at the two little girls  did you have a good time last night i tried to stay awake until you came home for i wanted to tell you aunt josephine had come and that you would have to go upstairs after all but i was so tired i fell asleep i hope you didnt disturb your aunt diana  diana preserved a discreet silence but she and anne exchanged furtive smiles of guilty amusement across the table anne hurried home after breakfast and so remained in blissful ignorance of the disturbance which presently resulted in the barry household until the late afternoon when she went down to mrs lyndes on an errand for marilla  so you and diana nearly frightened poor old miss barry to death last night said mrs lynde severely but with a twinkle in her eye mrs barry was here a few minutes ago on her way to carmody shes feeling real worried over it old miss barry was in a terrible temper when she got up this morning and josephine barrys temper is no joke i can tell you that she wouldnt speak to diana at all  it wasnt dianas fault said anne contritely it was mine i suggested racing to see who would get into bed first  i knew it said mrs lynde with the exultation of a correct guesser i knew that idea came out of your head well its made a nice lot of trouble thats what old miss barry came out to stay for a month but she declares she wont stay another day and is going right back to town tomorrow sunday and all as it is shed have gone today if they could have taken her she had promised to pay for a quarters music lessons for diana but now she is determined to do nothing at all for such a tomboy oh i guess they had a lively time of it there this morning the barrys must feel cut up old miss barry is rich and theyd like to keep on the good side of her of course mrs barry didnt say just that to me but im a pretty good judge of human nature thats what  im such an unlucky girl mourned anne im always getting into scrapes myself and getting my best friends people id shed my hearts blood for into them too can you tell me why it is so mrs lynde  its because youre too heedless and impulsive child thats what you never stop to think whatever comes into your head to say or do you say or do it without a moments reflection  oh but thats the best of it protested anne something just flashes into your mind so exciting and you must out with it if you stop to think it over you spoil it all havent you never felt that yourself mrs lynde  no mrs lynde had not she shook her head sagely  you must learn to think a little anne thats what the proverb you need to go by is ‘look before you leap especially into spare room beds  mrs lynde laughed comfortably over her mild joke but anne remained pensive she saw nothing to laugh at in the situation which to her eyes appeared very serious when she left mrs lyndes she took her way across the crusted fields to orchard slope diana met her at the kitchen door  your aunt josephine was very cross about it wasnt she whispered anne  yes answered diana stifling a giggle with an apprehensive glance over her shoulder at the closed sitting room door she was fairly dancing with rage anne oh how she scolded she said i was the worst behaved girl she ever saw and that my parents ought to be ashamed of the way they had brought me up she says she wont stay and im sure i dont care but father and mother do  why didnt you tell them it was my fault demanded anne  its likely id do such a thing isnt it said diana with just scorn im no telltale anne shirley and anyhow i was just as much to blame as you  well im going in to tell her myself said anne resolutely  diana stared  anne shirley youd never why shell eat you alive  dont frighten me any more than i am frightened implored anne id rather walk up to a cannons mouth but ive got to do it diana it was my fault and ive got to confess ive had practice in confessing fortunately  well shes in the room said diana you can go in if you want to i wouldnt dare and i dont believe youll do a bit of good  with this encouragement anne bearded the lion in its den that is to say walked resolutely up to the sitting room door and knocked faintly a sharp come in followed  miss josephine barry thin prim and rigid was knitting fiercely by the fire her wrath quite unappeased and her eyes snapping through her gold rimmed glasses she wheeled around in her chair expecting to see diana and beheld a white faced girl whose great eyes were brimmed up with a mixture of desperate courage and shrinking terror  who are you demanded miss josephine barry without ceremony  im anne of green gables said the small visitor tremulously clasping her hands with her characteristic gesture and ive come to confess if you please  confess what  that it was all my fault about jumping into bed on you last night i suggested it diana would never have thought of such a thing i am sure diana is a very ladylike girl miss barry so you must see how unjust it is to blame her  oh i must hey i rather think diana did her share of the jumping at least such carryings on in a respectable house  but we were only in fun persisted anne i think you ought to forgive us miss barry now that weve apologized and anyhow please forgive diana and let her have her music lessons dianas heart is set on her music lessons miss barry and i know too well what it is to set your heart on a thing and not get it if you must be cross with anyone be cross with me ive been so used in my early days to having people cross at me that i can endure it much better than diana can  much of the snap had gone out of the old ladys eyes by this time and was replaced by a twinkle of amused interest but she still said severely   i dont think it is any excuse for you that you were only in fun little girls never indulged in that kind of fun when i was young you dont know what it is to be awakened out of a sound sleep after a long and arduous journey by two great girls coming bounce down on you  i dont know but i can imagine said anne eagerly im sure it must have been very disturbing but then there is our side of it too have you any imagination miss barry if you have just put yourself in our place we didnt know there was anybody in that bed and you nearly scared us to death it was simply awful the way we felt and then we couldnt sleep in the spare room after being promised i suppose you are used to sleeping in spare rooms but just imagine what you would feel like if you were a little orphan girl who had never had such an honor  all the snap had gone by this time miss barry actually laughed a sound which caused diana waiting in speechless anxiety in the kitchen outside to give a great gasp of relief  im afraid my imagination is a little rusty its so long since i used it she said i dare say your claim to sympathy is just as strong as mine it all depends on the way we look at it sit down here and tell me about yourself  i am very sorry i cant said anne firmly i would like to because you seem like an interesting lady and you might even be a kindred spirit although you dont look very much like it but it is my duty to go home to miss marilla cuthbert miss marilla cuthbert is a very kind lady who has taken me to bring up properly she is doing her best but it is very discouraging work you must not blame her because i jumped on the bed but before i go i do wish you would tell me if you will forgive diana and stay just as long as you meant to in avonlea  i think perhaps i will if you will come over and talk to me occasionally said miss barry  that evening miss barry gave diana a silver bangle bracelet and told the senior members of the household that she had unpacked her valise  ive made up my mind to stay simply for the sake of getting better acquainted with that anne girl she said frankly she amuses me and at my time of life an amusing person is a rarity  marillas only comment when she heard the story was i told you so  this was for matthews benefit  miss barry stayed her month out and over she was a more agreeable guest than usual for anne kept her in good humor they became firm friends  when miss barry went away she said   remember you anne girl when you come to town youre to visit me and ill put you in my very sparest spare room bed to sleep  miss barry was a kindred spirit after all anne confided to marilla you wouldnt think so to look at her but she is you dont find it right out at first as in matthews case but after a while you come to see it kindred spirits are not so scarce as i used to think its splendid to find out there are so many of them in the world     chapter xx a good imagination gone wrong   spring had come once more to green gables the beautiful capricious reluctant canadian spring lingering along through april and may in a succession of sweet fresh chilly days with pink sunsets and miracles of resurrection and growth the maples in lovers lane were red budded and little curly ferns pushed up around the dryads bubble away up in the barrens behind mr silas sloanes place the mayflowers blossomed out pink and white stars of sweetness under their brown leaves all the school girls and boys had one golden afternoon gathering them coming home in the clear echoing twilight with arms and baskets full of flowery spoil  im so sorry for people who live in lands where there are no mayflowers said anne diana says perhaps they have something better but there couldnt be anything better than mayflowers could there marilla and diana says if they dont know what they are like they dont miss them but i think that is the saddest thing of all i think it would be tragic marilla not to know what mayflowers are like and not to miss them do you know what i think mayflowers are marilla i think they must be the souls of the flowers that died last summer and this is their heaven but we had a splendid time today marilla we had our lunch down in a big mossy hollow by an old well such a romantic spot charlie sloane dared arty gillis to jump over it and arty did because he wouldnt take a dare nobody would in school it is very fashionable to dare mr phillips gave all the mayflowers he found to prissy andrews and i heard him to say ‘sweets to the sweet he got that out of a book i know but it shows he has some imagination i was offered some mayflowers too but i rejected them with scorn i cant tell you the persons name because i have vowed never to let it cross my lips we made wreaths of the mayflowers and put them on our hats and when the time came to go home we marched in procession down the road two by two with our bouquets and wreaths singing ‘my home on the hill oh it was so thrilling marilla all mr silas sloanes folks rushed out to see us and everybody we met on the road stopped and stared after us we made a real sensation  not much wonder such silly doings was marillas response  after the mayflowers came the violets and violet vale was empurpled with them anne walked through it on her way to school with reverent steps and worshiping eyes as if she trod on holy ground  somehow she told diana when im going through here i dont really care whether gil whether anybody gets ahead of me in class or not but when im up in school its all different and i care as much as ever theres such a lot of different annes in me i sometimes think that is why im such a troublesome person if i was just the one anne it would be ever so much more comfortable but then it wouldnt be half so interesting  one june evening when the orchards were pink blossomed again when the frogs were singing silverly sweet in the marshes about the head of the lake of shining waters and the air was full of the savor of clover fields and balsamic fir woods anne was sitting by her gable window she had been studying her lessons but it had grown too dark to see the book so she had fallen into wide eyed reverie looking out past the boughs of the snow queen once more bestarred with its tufts of blossom  in all essential respects the little gable chamber was unchanged the walls were as white the pincushion as hard the chairs as stiffly and yellowly upright as ever yet the whole character of the room was altered it was full of a new vital pulsing personality that seemed to pervade it and to be quite independent of schoolgirl books and dresses and ribbons and even of the cracked blue jug full of apple blossoms on the table it was as if all the dreams sleeping and waking of its vivid occupant had taken a visible although unmaterial form and had tapestried the bare room with splendid filmy tissues of rainbow and moonshine presently marilla came briskly in with some of annes freshly ironed school aprons she hung them over a chair and sat down with a short sigh she had had one of her headaches that afternoon and although the pain had gone she felt weak and tuckered out as she expressed it anne looked at her with eyes limpid with sympathy  i do truly wish i could have had the headache in your place marilla i would have endured it joyfully for your sake  i guess you did your part in attending to the work and letting me rest said marilla you seem to have got on fairly well and made fewer mistakes than usual of course it wasnt exactly necessary to starch matthews handkerchiefs and most people when they put a pie in the oven to warm up for dinner take it out and eat it when it gets hot instead of leaving it to be burned to a crisp but that doesnt seem to be your way evidently  headaches always left marilla somewhat sarcastic  oh im so sorry said anne penitently i never thought about that pie from the moment i put it in the oven till now although i felt instinctively that there was something missing on the dinner table i was firmly resolved when you left me in charge this morning not to imagine anything but keep my thoughts on facts i did pretty well until i put the pie in and then an irresistible temptation came to me to imagine i was an enchanted princess shut up in a lonely tower with a handsome knight riding to my rescue on a coal black steed so that is how i came to forget the pie i didnt know i starched the handkerchiefs all the time i was ironing i was trying to think of a name for a new island diana and i have discovered up the brook its the most ravishing spot marilla there are two maple trees on it and the brook flows right around it at last it struck me that it would be splendid to call it victoria island because we found it on the queens birthday both diana and i are very loyal but im sorry about that pie and the handkerchiefs i wanted to be extra good today because its an anniversary do you remember what happened this day last year marilla  no i cant think of anything special  oh marilla it was the day i came to green gables i shall never forget it it was the turning point in my life of course it wouldnt seem so important to you ive been here for a year and ive been so happy of course ive had my troubles but one can live down troubles are you sorry you kept me marilla  no i cant say im sorry said marilla who sometimes wondered how she could have lived before anne came to green gables no not exactly sorry if youve finished your lessons anne i want you to run over and ask mrs barry if shell lend me dianas apron pattern  oh its its too dark cried anne  too dark why its only twilight and goodness knows youve gone over often enough after dark  ill go over early in the morning said anne eagerly ill get up at sunrise and go over marilla  what has got into your head now anne shirley i want that pattern to cut out your new apron this evening go at once and be smart too  ill have to go around by the road then said anne taking up her hat reluctantly  go by the road and waste half an hour id like to catch you  i cant go through the haunted wood marilla cried anne desperately  marilla stared  the haunted wood are you crazy what under the canopy is the haunted wood  the spruce wood over the brook said anne in a whisper  fiddlesticks there is no such thing as a haunted wood anywhere who has been telling you such stuff  nobody confessed anne diana and i just imagined the wood was haunted all the places around here are so so commonplace we just got this up for our own amusement we began it in april a haunted wood is so very romantic marilla we chose the spruce grove because its so gloomy oh we have imagined the most harrowing things theres a white lady walks along the brook just about this time of the night and wrings her hands and utters wailing cries she appears when there is to be a death in the family and the ghost of a little murdered child haunts the corner up by idlewild it creeps up behind you and lays its cold fingers on your hand so oh marilla it gives me a shudder to think of it and theres a headless man stalks up and down the path and skeletons glower at you between the boughs oh marilla i wouldnt go through the haunted wood after dark now for anything id be sure that white things would reach out from behind the trees and grab me  did ever anyone hear the like ejaculated marilla who had listened in dumb amazement anne shirley do you mean to tell me you believe all that wicked nonsense of your own imagination  not believe exactly faltered anne at least i dont believe it in daylight but after dark marilla its different that is when ghosts walk  there are no such things as ghosts anne  oh but there are marilla cried anne eagerly i know people who have seen them and they are respectable people charlie sloane says that his grandmother saw his grandfather driving home the cows one night after hed been buried for a year you know charlie sloanes grandmother wouldnt tell a story for anything shes a very religious woman and mrs thomass father was pursued home one night by a lamb of fire with its head cut off hanging by a strip of skin he said he knew it was the spirit of his brother and that it was a warning he would die within nine days he didnt but he died two years after so you see it was really true and ruby gillis says   anne shirley interrupted marilla firmly i never want to hear you talking in this fashion again ive had my doubts about that imagination of yours right along and if this is going to be the outcome of it i wont countenance any such doings youll go right over to barrys and youll go through that spruce grove just for a lesson and a warning to you and never let me hear a word out of your head about haunted woods again  anne might plead and cry as she liked and did for her terror was very real her imagination had run away with her and she held the spruce grove in mortal dread after nightfall but marilla was inexorable she marched the shrinking ghost seer down to the spring and ordered her to proceed straightway over the bridge and into the dusky retreats of wailing ladies and headless specters beyond  oh marilla how can you be so cruel sobbed anne what would you feel like if a white thing did snatch me up and carry me off  ill risk it said marilla unfeelingly you know i always mean what i say ill cure you of imagining ghosts into places march now  anne marched that is she stumbled over the bridge and went shuddering up the horrible dim path beyond anne never forgot that walk bitterly did she repent the license she had given to her imagination the goblins of her fancy lurked in every shadow about her reaching out their cold fleshless hands to grasp the terrified small girl who had called them into being a white strip of birch bark blowing up from the hollow over the brown floor of the grove made her heart stand still the long drawn wail of two old boughs rubbing against each other brought out the perspiration in beads on her forehead the swoop of bats in the darkness over her was as the wings of unearthly creatures when she reached mr william bells field she fled across it as if pursued by an army of white things and arrived at the barry kitchen door so out of breath that she could hardly gasp out her request for the apron pattern diana was away so that she had no excuse to linger the dreadful return journey had to be faced anne went back over it with shut eyes preferring to take the risk of dashing her brains out among the boughs to that of seeing a white thing when she finally stumbled over the log bridge she drew one long shivering breath of relief  well so nothing caught you said marilla unsympathetically  oh mar marilla chattered anne ill b b be contt tented with c c commonplace places after this     chapter xxi a new departure in flavorings   dear me there is nothing but meetings and partings in this world as mrs lynde says remarked anne plaintively putting her slate and books down on the kitchen table on the last day of june and wiping her red eyes with a very damp handkerchief wasnt it fortunate marilla that i took an extra handkerchief to school today i had a presentiment that it would be needed  i never thought you were so fond of mr phillips that youd require two handkerchiefs to dry your tears just because he was going away said marilla  i dont think i was crying because i was really so very fond of him  reflected anne i just cried because all the others did it was ruby gillis started it ruby gillis has always declared she hated mr phillips but just as soon as he got up to make his farewell speech she burst into tears then all the girls began to cry one after the other i tried to hold out marilla i tried to remember the time mr phillips made me sit with gil with a boy and the time he spelled my name without an ‘e on the blackboard and how he said i was the worst dunce he ever saw at geometry and laughed at my spelling and all the times he had been so horrid and sarcastic but somehow i couldnt marilla and i just had to cry too jane andrews has been talking for a month about how glad shed be when mr phillips went away and she declared shed never shed a tear well she was worse than any of us and had to borrow a handkerchief from her brother of course the boys didnt cry because she hadnt brought one of her own not expecting to need it oh marilla it was heartrending mr phillips made such a beautiful farewell speech beginning ‘the time has come for us to part it was very affecting and he had tears in his eyes too marilla oh i felt dreadfully sorry and remorseful for all the times id talked in school and drawn pictures of him on my slate and made fun of him and prissy i can tell you i wished id been a model pupil like minnie andrews she hadnt anything on her conscience the girls cried all the way home from school carrie sloane kept saying every few minutes ‘the time has come for us to part and that would start us off again whenever we were in any danger of cheering up i do feel dreadfully sad marilla but one cant feel quite in the depths of despair with two months vacation before them can they marilla and besides we met the new minister and his wife coming from the station for all i was feeling so bad about mr phillips going away i couldnt help taking a little interest in a new minister could i his wife is very pretty not exactly regally lovely of course it wouldnt do i suppose for a minister to have a regally lovely wife because it might set a bad example mrs lynde says the ministers wife over at newbridge sets a very bad example because she dresses so fashionably our new ministers wife was dressed in blue muslin with lovely puffed sleeves and a hat trimmed with roses jane andrews said she thought puffed sleeves were too worldly for a ministers wife but i didnt make any such uncharitable remark marilla because i know what it is to long for puffed sleeves besides shes only been a ministers wife for a little while so one should make allowances shouldnt they they are going to board with mrs lynde until the manse is ready  if marilla in going down to mrs lyndes that evening was actuated by any motive save her avowed one of returning the quilting frames she had borrowed the preceding winter it was an amiable weakness shared by most of the avonlea people many a thing mrs lynde had lent sometimes never expecting to see it again came home that night in charge of the borrowers thereof a new minister and moreover a minister with a wife was a lawful object of curiosity in a quiet little country settlement where sensations were few and far between  old mr bentley the minister whom anne had found lacking in imagination had been pastor of avonlea for eighteen years he was a widower when he came and a widower he remained despite the fact that gossip regularly married him to this that or the other one every year of his sojourn in the preceding february he had resigned his charge and departed amid the regrets of his people most of whom had the affection born of long intercourse for their good old minister in spite of his shortcomings as an orator since then the avonlea church had enjoyed a variety of religious dissipation in listening to the many and various candidates and supplies who came sunday after sunday to preach on trial these stood or fell by the judgment of the fathers and mothers in israel but a certain small red haired girl who sat meekly in the corner of the old cuthbert pew also had her opinions about them and discussed the same in full with matthew marilla always declining from principle to criticize ministers in any shape or form  i dont think mr smith would have done matthew was annes final summing up mrs lynde says his delivery was so poor but i think his worst fault was just like mr bentleys he had no imagination and mr terry had too much he let it run away with him just as i did mine in the matter of the haunted wood besides mrs lynde says his theology wasnt sound mr gresham was a very good man and a very religious man but he told too many funny stories and made the people laugh in church he was undignified and you must have some dignity about a minister mustnt you matthew i thought mr marshall was decidedly attractive but mrs lynde says he isnt married or even engaged because she made special inquiries about him and she says it would never do to have a young unmarried minister in avonlea because he might marry in the congregation and that would make trouble mrs lynde is a very farseeing woman isnt she matthew im very glad theyve called mr allan i liked him because his sermon was interesting and he prayed as if he meant it and not just as if he did it because he was in the habit of it mrs lynde says he isnt perfect but she says she supposes we couldnt expect a perfect minister for seven hundred and fifty dollars a year and anyhow his theology is sound because she questioned him thoroughly on all the points of doctrine and she knows his wifes people and they are most respectable and the women are all good housekeepers mrs lynde says that sound doctrine in the man and good housekeeping in the woman make an ideal combination for a ministers family  the new minister and his wife were a young pleasant faced couple still on their honeymoon and full of all good and beautiful enthusiasms for their chosen lifework avonlea opened its heart to them from the start old and young liked the frank cheerful young man with his high ideals and the bright gentle little lady who assumed the mistress ship of the manse with mrs allan anne fell promptly and wholeheartedly in love she had discovered another kindred spirit  mrs allan is perfectly lovely she announced one sunday afternoon shes taken our class and shes a splendid teacher she said right away she didnt think it was fair for the teacher to ask all the questions and you know marilla that is exactly what ive always thought she said we could ask her any question we liked and i asked ever so many im good at asking questions marilla  i believe you was marillas emphatic comment  nobody else asked any except ruby gillis and she asked if there was to be a sunday school picnic this summer i didnt think that was a very proper question to ask because it hadnt any connection with the lesson the lesson was about daniel in the lions den but mrs allan just smiled and said she thought there would be mrs allan has a lovely smile she has such exquisite dimples in her cheeks i wish i had dimples in my cheeks marilla im not half so skinny as i was when i came here but i have no dimples yet if i had perhaps i could influence people for good mrs allan said we ought always to try to influence other people for good she talked so nice about everything i never knew before that religion was such a cheerful thing i always thought it was kind of melancholy but mrs allans isnt and id like to be a christian if i could be one like her i wouldnt want to be one like mr superintendent bell  its very naughty of you to speak so about mr bell said marilla severely mr bell is a real good man  oh of course hes good agreed anne but he doesnt seem to get any comfort out of it if i could be good id dance and sing all day because i was glad of it i suppose mrs allan is too old to dance and sing and of course it wouldnt be dignified in a ministers wife but i can just feel shes glad shes a christian and that shed be one even if she could get to heaven without it  i suppose we must have mr and mrs allan up to tea someday soon said marilla reflectively theyve been most everywhere but here let me see next wednesday would be a good time to have them but dont say a word to matthew about it for if he knew they were coming hed find some excuse to be away that day hed got so used to mr bentley he didnt mind him but hes going to find it hard to get acquainted with a new minister and a new ministers wife will frighten him to death  ill be as secret as the dead assured anne but oh marilla will you let me make a cake for the occasion id love to do something for mrs allan and you know i can make a pretty good cake by this time  you can make a layer cake promised marilla  monday and tuesday great preparations went on at green gables having the minister and his wife to tea was a serious and important undertaking and marilla was determined not to be eclipsed by any of the avonlea housekeepers anne was wild with excitement and delight she talked it all over with diana tuesday night in the twilight as they sat on the big red stones by the dryads bubble and made rainbows in the water with little twigs dipped in fir balsam  everything is ready diana except my cake which im to make in the morning and the baking powder biscuits which marilla will make just before teatime i assure you diana that marilla and i have had a busy two days of it its such a responsibility having a ministers family to tea i never went through such an experience before you should just see our pantry its a sight to behold were going to have jellied chicken and cold tongue were to have two kinds of jelly red and yellow and whipped cream and lemon pie and cherry pie and three kinds of cookies and fruit cake and marillas famous yellow plum preserves that she keeps especially for ministers and pound cake and layer cake and biscuits as aforesaid and new bread and old both in case the minister is dyspeptic and cant eat new mrs lynde says ministers are dyspeptic but i dont think mr allan has been a minister long enough for it to have had a bad effect on him i just grow cold when i think of my layer cake oh diana what if it shouldnt be good i dreamed last night that i was chased all around by a fearful goblin with a big layer cake for a head  itll be good all right assured diana who was a very comfortable sort of friend im sure that piece of the one you made that we had for lunch in idlewild two weeks ago was perfectly elegant  yes but cakes have such a terrible habit of turning out bad just when you especially want them to be good sighed anne setting a particularly well balsamed twig afloat however i suppose i shall just have to trust to providence and be careful to put in the flour oh look diana what a lovely rainbow do you suppose the dryad will come out after we go away and take it for a scarf  you know there is no such thing as a dryad said diana dianas mother had found out about the haunted wood and had been decidedly angry over it as a result diana had abstained from any further imitative flights of imagination and did not think it prudent to cultivate a spirit of belief even in harmless dryads  but its so easy to imagine there is said anne every night before i go to bed i look out of my window and wonder if the dryad is really sitting here combing her locks with the spring for a mirror sometimes i look for her footprints in the dew in the morning oh diana dont give up your faith in the dryad  wednesday morning came anne got up at sunrise because she was too excited to sleep she had caught a severe cold in the head by reason of her dabbling in the spring on the preceding evening but nothing short of absolute pneumonia could have quenched her interest in culinary matters that morning after breakfast she proceeded to make her cake when she finally shut the oven door upon it she drew a long breath  im sure i havent forgotten anything this time marilla but do you think it will rise just suppose perhaps the baking powder isnt good i used it out of the new can and mrs lynde says you can never be sure of getting good baking powder nowadays when everything is so adulterated mrs lynde says the government ought to take the matter up but she says well never see the day when a tory government will do it marilla what if that cake doesnt rise  well have plenty without it was marillas unimpassioned way of looking at the subject  the cake did rise however and came out of the oven as light and feathery as golden foam anne flushed with delight clapped it together with layers of ruby jelly and in imagination saw mrs allan eating it and possibly asking for another piece  youll be using the best tea set of course marilla she said can i fix the table with ferns and wild roses  i think thats all nonsense sniffed marilla in my opinion its the eatables that matter and not flummery decorations  mrs barry had her table decorated said anne who was not entirely guiltless of the wisdom of the serpent and the minister paid her an elegant compliment he said it was a feast for the eye as well as the palate  well do as you like said marilla who was quite determined not to be surpassed by mrs barry or anybody else only mind you leave enough room for the dishes and the food  anne laid herself out to decorate in a manner and after a fashion that should leave mrs barrys nowhere having abundance of roses and ferns and a very artistic taste of her own she made that tea table such a thing of beauty that when the minister and his wife sat down to it they exclaimed in chorus over it loveliness  its annes doings said marilla grimly just and anne felt that mrs allans approving smile was almost too much happiness for this world  matthew was there having been inveigled into the party only goodness and anne knew how he had been in such a state of shyness and nervousness that marilla had given him up in despair but anne took him in hand so successfully that he now sat at the table in his best clothes and white collar and talked to the minister not uninterestingly he never said a word to mrs allan but that perhaps was not to be expected  all went merry as a marriage bell until annes layer cake was passed mrs allan having already been helped to a bewildering variety declined it but marilla seeing the disappointment on annes face said smilingly   oh you must take a piece of this mrs allan anne made it on purpose for you  in that case i must sample it laughed mrs allan helping herself to a plump triangle as did also the minister and marilla  mrs allan took a mouthful of hers and a most peculiar expression crossed her face not a word did she say however but steadily ate away at it marilla saw the expression and hastened to taste the cake  anne shirley she exclaimed what on earth did you put into that cake  nothing but what the recipe said marilla cried anne with a look of anguish oh isnt it all right  all right its simply horrible mr allan dont try to eat it anne taste it yourself what flavoring did you use  vanilla said anne her face scarlet with mortification after tasting the cake only vanilla oh marilla it must have been the baking powder i had my suspicions of that bak   baking powder fiddlesticks go and bring me the bottle of vanilla you used  anne fled to the pantry and returned with a small bottle partially filled with a brown liquid and labeled yellowly best vanilla  marilla took it uncorked it smelled it  mercy on us anne youve flavored that cake with anodyne liniment i broke the liniment bottle last week and poured what was left into an old empty vanilla bottle i suppose its partly my fault i should have warned you but for pitys sake why couldnt you have smelled it  anne dissolved into tears under this double disgrace  i couldnt i had such a cold and with this she fairly fled to the gable chamber where she cast herself on the bed and wept as one who refuses to be comforted  presently a light step sounded on the stairs and somebody entered the room  oh marilla sobbed anne without looking up im disgraced forever i shall never be able to live this down it will get out things always do get out in avonlea diana will ask me how my cake turned out and i shall have to tell her the truth i shall always be pointed at as the girl who flavored a cake with anodyne liniment gil the boys in school will never get over laughing at it oh marilla if you have a spark of christian pity dont tell me that i must go down and wash the dishes after this ill wash them when the minister and his wife are gone but i cannot ever look mrs allan in the face again perhaps shell think i tried to poison her mrs lynde says she knows an orphan girl who tried to poison her benefactor but the liniment isnt poisonous its meant to be taken internally although not in cakes wont you tell mrs allan so marilla  suppose you jump up and tell her so yourself said a merry voice  anne flew up to find mrs allan standing by her bed surveying her with laughing eyes  my dear little girl you mustnt cry like this she said genuinely disturbed by annes tragic face why its all just a funny mistake that anybody might make  oh no it takes me to make such a mistake said anne forlornly and i wanted to have that cake so nice for you mrs allan  yes i know dear and i assure you i appreciate your kindness and thoughtfulness just as much as if it had turned out all right now you mustnt cry any more but come down with me and show me your flower garden miss cuthbert tells me you have a little plot all your own i want to see it for im very much interested in flowers  anne permitted herself to be led down and comforted reflecting that it was really providential that mrs allan was a kindred spirit nothing more was said about the liniment cake and when the guests went away anne found that she had enjoyed the evening more than could have been expected considering that terrible incident nevertheless she sighed deeply  marilla isnt it nice to think that tomorrow is a new day with no mistakes in it yet  ill warrant youll make plenty in it said marilla i never saw your beat for making mistakes anne  yes and well i know it admitted anne mournfully but have you ever noticed one encouraging thing about me marilla i never make the same mistake twice  i dont know as thats much benefit when youre always making new ones  oh dont you see marilla there must be a limit to the mistakes one person can make and when i get to the end of them then ill be through with them thats a very comforting thought  well youd better go and give that cake to the pigs said marilla it isnt fit for any human to eat not even jerry boute     chapter xxii anne is invited out to tea   and what are your eyes popping out of your head about now asked marilla when anne had just come in from a run to the post office have you discovered another kindred spirit excitement hung around anne like a garment shone in her eyes kindled in every feature she had come dancing up the lane like a wind blown sprite through the mellow sunshine and lazy shadows of the august evening  no marilla but oh what do you think i am invited to tea at the manse tomorrow afternoon mrs allan left the letter for me at the post office just look at it marilla ‘miss anne shirley green gables that is the first time i was ever called ‘miss such a thrill as it gave me i shall cherish it forever among my choicest treasures  mrs allan told me she meant to have all the members of her sunday school class to tea in turn said marilla regarding the wonderful event very coolly you neednt get in such a fever over it do learn to take things calmly child  for anne to take things calmly would have been to change her nature all spirit and fire and dew as she was the pleasures and pains of life came to her with trebled intensity marilla felt this and was vaguely troubled over it realizing that the ups and downs of existence would probably bear hardly on this impulsive soul and not sufficiently understanding that the equally great capacity for delight might more than compensate therefore marilla conceived it to be her duty to drill anne into a tranquil uniformity of disposition as impossible and alien to her as to a dancing sunbeam in one of the brook shallows she did not make much headway as she sorrowfully admitted to herself the downfall of some dear hope or plan plunged anne into deeps of affliction the fulfillment thereof exalted her to dizzy realms of delight marilla had almost begun to despair of ever fashioning this waif of the world into her model little girl of demure manners and prim deportment neither would she have believed that she really liked anne much better as she was  anne went to bed that night speechless with misery because matthew had said the wind was round northeast and he feared it would be a rainy day tomorrow the rustle of the poplar leaves about the house worried her it sounded so like pattering raindrops and the full faraway roar of the gulf to which she listened delightedly at other times loving its strange sonorous haunting rhythm now seemed like a prophecy of storm and disaster to a small maiden who particularly wanted a fine day anne thought that the morning would never come  but all things have an end even nights before the day on which you are invited to take tea at the manse the morning in spite of matthews predictions was fine and annes spirits soared to their highest oh marilla there is something in me today that makes me just love everybody i see she exclaimed as she washed the breakfast dishes you dont know how good i feel wouldnt it be nice if it could last i believe i could be a model child if i were just invited out to tea every day but oh marilla its a solemn occasion too i feel so anxious what if i shouldnt behave properly you know i never had tea at a manse before and im not sure that i know all the rules of etiquette although ive been studying the rules given in the etiquette department of the family herald ever since i came here im so afraid ill do something silly or forget to do something i should do would it be good manners to take a second helping of anything if you wanted to very much  the trouble with you anne is that youre thinking too much about yourself you should just think of mrs allan and what would be nicest and most agreeable to her said marilla hitting for once in her life on a very sound and pithy piece of advice anne instantly realized this  you are right marilla ill try not to think about myself at all  anne evidently got through her visit without any serious breach of etiquette for she came home through the twilight under a great high sprung sky gloried over with trails of saffron and rosy cloud in a beatified state of mind and told marilla all about it happily sitting on the big red sandstone slab at the kitchen door with her tired curly head in marillas gingham lap  a cool wind was blowing down over the long harvest fields from the rims of firry western hills and whistling through the poplars one clear star hung over the orchard and the fireflies were flitting over in lovers lane in and out among the ferns and rustling boughs anne watched them as she talked and somehow felt that wind and stars and fireflies were all tangled up together into something unutterably sweet and enchanting  oh marilla ive had a most fascinating time i feel that i have not lived in vain and i shall always feel like that even if i should never be invited to tea at a manse again when i got there mrs allan met me at the door she was dressed in the sweetest dress of pale pink organdy with dozens of frills and elbow sleeves and she looked just like a seraph i really think id like to be a ministers wife when i grow up marilla a minister mightnt mind my red hair because he wouldnt be thinking of such worldly things but then of course one would have to be naturally good and ill never be that so i suppose theres no use in thinking about it some people are naturally good you know and others are not im one of the others mrs lynde says im full of original sin no matter how hard i try to be good i can never make such a success of it as those who are naturally good its a good deal like geometry i expect but dont you think the trying so hard ought to count for something mrs allan is one of the naturally good people i love her passionately you know there are some people like matthew and mrs allan that you can love right off without any trouble and there are others like mrs lynde that you have to try very hard to love you know you ought to love them because they know so much and are such active workers in the church but you have to keep reminding yourself of it all the time or else you forget there was another little girl at the manse to tea from the white sands sunday school her name was laurette bradley and she was a very nice little girl not exactly a kindred spirit you know but still very nice we had an elegant tea and i think i kept all the rules of etiquette pretty well after tea mrs allan played and sang and she got lauretta and me to sing too mrs allan says i have a good voice and she says i must sing in the sunday school choir after this you cant think how i was thrilled at the mere thought ive longed so to sing in the sunday school choir as diana does but i feared it was an honor i could never aspire to lauretta had to go home early because there is a big concert in the white sands hotel tonight and her sister is to recite at it lauretta says that the americans at the hotel give a concert every fortnight in aid of the charlottetown hospital and they ask lots of the white sands people to recite lauretta said she expected to be asked herself someday i just gazed at her in awe after she had gone mrs allan and i had a heart to heart talk i told her everything about mrs thomas and the twins and katie maurice and violetta and coming to green gables and my troubles over geometry and would you believe it marilla mrs allan told me she was a dunce at geometry too you dont know how that encouraged me mrs lynde came to the manse just before i left and what do you think marilla the trustees have hired a new teacher and its a lady her name is miss muriel stacy isnt that a romantic name mrs lynde says theyve never had a female teacher in avonlea before and she thinks it is a dangerous innovation but i think it will be splendid to have a lady teacher and i really dont see how im going to live through the two weeks before school begins im so impatient to see her     chapter xxiii anne comes to grief in an affair of honor   anne had to live through more than two weeks as it happened almost a month having elapsed since the liniment cake episode it was high time for her to get into fresh trouble of some sort little mistakes such as absentmindedly emptying a pan of skim milk into a basket of yarn balls in the pantry instead of into the pigs bucket and walking clean over the edge of the log bridge into the brook while wrapped in imaginative reverie not really being worth counting  a week after the tea at the manse diana barry gave a party  small and select anne assured marilla just the girls in our class  they had a very good time and nothing untoward happened until after tea when they found themselves in the barry garden a little tired of all their games and ripe for any enticing form of mischief which might present itself this presently took the form of daring  daring was the fashionable amusement among the avonlea small fry just then it had begun among the boys but soon spread to the girls and all the silly things that were done in avonlea that summer because the doers thereof were dared to do them would fill a book by themselves  first of all carrie sloane dared ruby gillis to climb to a certain point in the huge old willow tree before the front door which ruby gillis albeit in mortal dread of the fat green caterpillars with which said tree was infested and with the fear of her mother before her eyes if she should tear her new muslin dress nimbly did to the discomfiture of the aforesaid carrie sloane then josie pye dared jane andrews to hop on her left leg around the garden without stopping once or putting her right foot to the ground which jane andrews gamely tried to do but gave out at the third corner and had to confess herself defeated  josies triumph being rather more pronounced than good taste permitted anne shirley dared her to walk along the top of the board fence which bounded the garden to the east now to walk board fences requires more skill and steadiness of head and heel than one might suppose who has never tried it but josie pye if deficient in some qualities that make for popularity had at least a natural and inborn gift duly cultivated for walking board fences josie walked the barry fence with an airy unconcern which seemed to imply that a little thing like that wasnt worth a dare reluctant admiration greeted her exploit for most of the other girls could appreciate it having suffered many things themselves in their efforts to walk fences josie descended from her perch flushed with victory and darted a defiant glance at anne  anne tossed her red braids  i dont think its such a very wonderful thing to walk a little low board fence she said i knew a girl in marysville who could walk the ridgepole of a roof  i dont believe it said josie flatly i dont believe anybody could walk a ridgepole you couldnt anyhow  couldnt i cried anne rashly  then i dare you to do it said josie defiantly i dare you to climb up there and walk the ridgepole of mr barrys kitchen roof  anne turned pale but there was clearly only one thing to be done she walked toward the house where a ladder was leaning against the kitchen roof all the fifth class girls said oh partly in excitement partly in dismay  dont you do it anne entreated diana youll fall off and be killed never mind josie pye it isnt fair to dare anybody to do anything so dangerous  i must do it my honor is at stake said anne solemnly i shall walk that ridgepole diana or perish in the attempt if i am killed you are to have my pearl bead ring  anne climbed the ladder amid breathless silence gained the ridgepole balanced herself uprightly on that precarious footing and started to walk along it dizzily conscious that she was uncomfortably high up in the world and that walking ridgepoles was not a thing in which your imagination helped you out much nevertheless she managed to take several steps before the catastrophe came then she swayed lost her balance stumbled staggered and fell sliding down over the sun baked roof and crashing off it through the tangle of virginia creeper beneath all before the dismayed circle below could give a simultaneous terrified shriek  if anne had tumbled off the roof on the side up which she had ascended diana would probably have fallen heir to the pearl bead ring then and there fortunately she fell on the other side where the roof extended down over the porch so nearly to the ground that a fall therefrom was a much less serious thing nevertheless when diana and the other girls had rushed frantically around the house except ruby gillis who remained as if rooted to the ground and went into hysterics they found anne lying all white and limp among the wreck and ruin of the virginia creeper  anne are you killed shrieked diana throwing herself on her knees beside her friend oh anne dear anne speak just one word to me and tell me if youre killed  to the immense relief of all the girls and especially of josie pye who in spite of lack of imagination had been seized with horrible visions of a future branded as the girl who was the cause of anne shirleys early and tragic death anne sat dizzily up and answered uncertainly   no diana i am not killed but i think i am rendered unconscious  where sobbed carrie sloane oh where anne before anne could answer mrs barry appeared on the scene at sight of her anne tried to scramble to her feet but sank back again with a sharp little cry of pain  whats the matter where have you hurt yourself demanded mrs barry  my ankle gasped anne oh diana please find your father and ask him to take me home i know i can never walk there and im sure i couldnt hop so far on one foot when jane couldnt even hop around the garden  marilla was out in the orchard picking a panful of summer apples when she saw mr barry coming over the log bridge and up the slope with mrs barry beside him and a whole procession of little girls trailing after him in his arms he carried anne whose head lay limply against his shoulder  at that moment marilla had a revelation in the sudden stab of fear that pierced her very heart she realized what anne had come to mean to her she would have admitted that she liked anne nay that she was very fond of anne but now she knew as she hurried wildly down the slope that anne was dearer to her than anything else on earth  mr barry what has happened to her she gasped more white and shaken than the self contained sensible marilla had been for many years  anne herself answered lifting her head  dont be very frightened marilla i was walking the ridgepole and i fell off i expect i have sprained my ankle but marilla i might have broken my neck let us look on the bright side of things  i might have known youd go and do something of the sort when i let you go to that party said marilla sharp and shrewish in her very relief bring her in here mr barry and lay her on the sofa mercy me the child has gone and fainted  it was quite true overcome by the pain of her injury anne had one more of her wishes granted to her she had fainted dead away  matthew hastily summoned from the harvest field was straightway dispatched for the doctor who in due time came to discover that the injury was more serious than they had supposed annes ankle was broken  that night when marilla went up to the east gable where a white faced girl was lying a plaintive voice greeted her from the bed  arent you very sorry for me marilla  it was your own fault said marilla twitching down the blind and lighting a lamp  and that is just why you should be sorry for me said anne because the thought that it is all my own fault is what makes it so hard if i could blame it on anybody i would feel so much better but what would you have done marilla if you had been dared to walk a ridgepole  id have stayed on good firm ground and let them dare away such absurdity said marilla  anne sighed  but you have such strength of mind marilla i havent i just felt that i couldnt bear josie pyes scorn she would have crowed over me all my life and i think i have been punished so much that you neednt be very cross with me marilla its not a bit nice to faint after all and the doctor hurt me dreadfully when he was setting my ankle i wont be able to go around for six or seven weeks and ill miss the new lady teacher she wont be new any more by the time im able to go to school and gil everybody will get ahead of me in class oh i am an afflicted mortal but ill try to bear it all bravely if only you wont be cross with me marilla  there there im not cross said marilla youre an unlucky child theres no doubt about that but as you say youll have the suffering of it here now try and eat some supper  isnt it fortunate ive got such an imagination said anne it will help me through splendidly i expect what do people who havent any imagination do when they break their bones do you suppose marilla  anne had good reason to bless her imagination many a time and oft during the tedious seven weeks that followed but she was not solely dependent on it she had many visitors and not a day passed without one or more of the schoolgirls dropping in to bring her flowers and books and tell her all the happenings in the juvenile world of avonlea  everybody has been so good and kind marilla sighed anne happily on the day when she could first limp across the floor it isnt very pleasant to be laid up but there is a bright side to it marilla you find out how many friends you have why even superintendent bell came to see me and hes really a very fine man not a kindred spirit of course but still i like him and im awfully sorry i ever criticized his prayers i believe now he really does mean them only he has got into the habit of saying them as if he didnt he could get over that if hed take a little trouble i gave him a good broad hint i told him how hard i tried to make my own little private prayers interesting he told me all about the time he broke his ankle when he was a boy it does seem so strange to think of superintendent bell ever being a boy even my imagination has its limits for i cant imagine that when i try to imagine him as a boy i see him with gray whiskers and spectacles just as he looks in sunday school only small now its so easy to imagine mrs allan as a little girl mrs allan has been to see me fourteen times isnt that something to be proud of marilla when a ministers wife has so many claims on her time she is such a cheerful person to have visit you too she never tells you its your own fault and she hopes youll be a better girl on account of it mrs lynde always told me that when she came to see me and she said it in a kind of way that made me feel she might hope id be a better girl but didnt really believe i would even josie pye came to see me i received her as politely as i could because i think she was sorry she dared me to walk a ridgepole if i had been killed she would had to carry a dark burden of remorse all her life diana has been a faithful friend shes been over every day to cheer my lonely pillow but oh i shall be so glad when i can go to school for ive heard such exciting things about the new teacher the girls all think she is perfectly sweet diana says she has the loveliest fair curly hair and such fascinating eyes she dresses beautifully and her sleeve puffs are bigger than anybody elses in avonlea every other friday afternoon she has recitations and everybody has to say a piece or take part in a dialogue oh its just glorious to think of it josie pye says she hates it but that is just because josie has so little imagination diana and ruby gillis and jane andrews are preparing a dialogue called ‘a morning visit for next friday and the friday afternoons they dont have recitations miss stacy takes them all to the woods for a ‘field day and they study ferns and flowers and birds and they have physical culture exercises every morning and evening mrs lynde says she never heard of such goings on and it all comes of having a lady teacher but i think it must be splendid and i believe i shall find that miss stacy is a kindred spirit  theres one thing plain to be seen anne said marilla and that is that your fall off the barry roof hasnt injured your tongue at all     chapter xxiv miss stacy and her pupils get up a concert   it was october again when anne was ready to go back to school a glorious october all red and gold with mellow mornings when the valleys were filled with delicate mists as if the spirit of autumn had poured them in for the sun to drain amethyst pearl silver rose and smoke blue the dews were so heavy that the fields glistened like cloth of silver and there were such heaps of rustling leaves in the hollows of many stemmed woods to run crisply through the birch path was a canopy of yellow and the ferns were sear and brown all along it there was a tang in the very air that inspired the hearts of small maidens tripping unlike snails swiftly and willingly to school and it was jolly to be back again at the little brown desk beside diana with ruby gillis nodding across the aisle and carrie sloane sending up notes and julia bell passing a chew of gum down from the back seat anne drew a long breath of happiness as she sharpened her pencil and arranged her picture cards in her desk life was certainly very interesting  in the new teacher she found another true and helpful friend miss stacy was a bright sympathetic young woman with the happy gift of winning and holding the affections of her pupils and bringing out the best that was in them mentally and morally anne expanded like a flower under this wholesome influence and carried home to the admiring matthew and the critical marilla glowing accounts of schoolwork and aims  i love miss stacy with my whole heart marilla she is so ladylike and she has such a sweet voice when she pronounces my name i feel instinctively that shes spelling it with an e we had recitations this afternoon i just wish you could have been there to hear me recite ‘mary queen of scots i just put my whole soul into it ruby gillis told me coming home that the way i said the line ‘now for my fathers arm she said ‘my womans heart farewell just made her blood run cold  well now you might recite it for me some of these days out in the barn suggested matthew  of course i will said anne meditatively but i wont be able to do it so well i know it wont be so exciting as it is when you have a whole schoolful before you hanging breathlessly on your words i know i wont be able to make your blood run cold  mrs lynde says it made her blood run cold to see the boys climbing to the very tops of those big trees on bells hill after crows nests last friday said marilla i wonder at miss stacy for encouraging it  but we wanted a crows nest for nature study explained anne that was on our field afternoon field afternoons are splendid marilla and miss stacy explains everything so beautifully we have to write compositions on our field afternoons and i write the best ones  its very vain of you to say so then youd better let your teacher say it  but she did say it marilla and indeed im not vain about it how can i be when im such a dunce at geometry although im really beginning to see through it a little too miss stacy makes it so clear still ill never be good at it and i assure you it is a humbling reflection but i love writing compositions mostly miss stacy lets us choose our own subjects but next week we are to write a composition on some remarkable person its hard to choose among so many remarkable people who have lived mustnt it be splendid to be remarkable and have compositions written about you after youre dead oh i would dearly love to be remarkable i think when i grow up ill be a trained nurse and go with the red crosses to the field of battle as a messenger of mercy that is if i dont go out as a foreign missionary that would be very romantic but one would have to be very good to be a missionary and that would be a stumbling block we have physical culture exercises every day too they make you graceful and promote digestion  promote fiddlesticks said marilla who honestly thought it was all nonsense  but all the field afternoons and recitation fridays and physical culture contortions paled before a project which miss stacy brought forward in november this was that the scholars of avonlea school should get up a concert and hold it in the hall on christmas night for the laudable purpose of helping to pay for a schoolhouse flag the pupils one and all taking graciously to this plan the preparations for a program were begun at once and of all the excited performers elect none was so excited as anne shirley who threw herself into the undertaking heart and soul hampered as she was by marillas disapproval marilla thought it all rank foolishness  its just filling your heads up with nonsense and taking time that ought to be put on your lessons she grumbled i dont approve of childrens getting up concerts and racing about to practices it makes them vain and forward and fond of gadding  but think of the worthy object pleaded anne a flag will cultivate a spirit of patriotism marilla  fudge theres precious little patriotism in the thoughts of any of you all you want is a good time  well when you can combine patriotism and fun isnt it all right of course its real nice to be getting up a concert were going to have six choruses and diana is to sing a solo im in two dialogues ‘the society for the suppression of gossip and ‘the fairy queen the boys are going to have a dialogue too and im to have two recitations marilla i just tremble when i think of it but its a nice thrilly kind of tremble and were to have a tableau at the last ‘faith hope and charity diana and ruby and i are to be in it all draped in white with flowing hair im to be hope with my hands clasped so and my eyes uplifted im going to practice my recitations in the garret dont be alarmed if you hear me groaning i have to groan heartrendingly in one of them and its really hard to get up a good artistic groan marilla josie pye is sulky because she didnt get the part she wanted in the dialogue she wanted to be the fairy queen that would have been ridiculous for who ever heard of a fairy queen as fat as josie fairy queens must be slender jane andrews is to be the queen and i am to be one of her maids of honor josie says she thinks a red haired fairy is just as ridiculous as a fat one but i do not let myself mind what josie says im to have a wreath of white roses on my hair and ruby gillis is going to lend me her slippers because i havent any of my own its necessary for fairies to have slippers you know you couldnt imagine a fairy wearing boots could you especially with copper toes we are going to decorate the hall with creeping spruce and fir mottoes with pink tissue paper roses in them and we are all to march in two by two after the audience is seated while emma white plays a march on the organ oh marilla i know you are not so enthusiastic about it as i am but dont you hope your little anne will distinguish herself  all i hope is that youll behave yourself ill be heartily glad when all this fuss is over and youll be able to settle down you are simply good for nothing just now with your head stuffed full of dialogues and groans and tableaus as for your tongue its a marvel its not clean worn out  anne sighed and betook herself to the back yard over which a young new moon was shining through the leafless poplar boughs from an apple green western sky and where matthew was splitting wood anne perched herself on a block and talked the concert over with him sure of an appreciative and sympathetic listener in this instance at least  well now i reckon its going to be a pretty good concert and i expect youll do your part fine he said smiling down into her eager vivacious little face anne smiled back at him those two were the best of friends and matthew thanked his stars many a time and oft that he had nothing to do with bringing her up that was marillas exclusive duty if it had been his he would have been worried over frequent conflicts between inclination and said duty as it was he was free to spoil anne marillas phrasing as much as he liked but it was not such a bad arrangement after all a little appreciation sometimes does quite as much good as all the conscientious bringing up in the world     chapter xxv matthew insists on puffed sleeves   matthew was having a bad ten minutes of it he had come into the kitchen in the twilight of a cold gray december evening and had sat down in the woodbox corner to take off his heavy boots unconscious of the fact that anne and a bevy of her schoolmates were having a practice of the fairy queen in the sitting room presently they came trooping through the hall and out into the kitchen laughing and chattering gaily they did not see matthew who shrank bashfully back into the shadows beyond the woodbox with a boot in one hand and a bootjack in the other and he watched them shyly for the aforesaid ten minutes as they put on caps and jackets and talked about the dialogue and the concert anne stood among them bright eyed and animated as they but matthew suddenly became conscious that there was something about her different from her mates and what worried matthew was that the difference impressed him as being something that should not exist anne had a brighter face and bigger starrier eyes and more delicate features than the other even shy unobservant matthew had learned to take note of these things but the difference that disturbed him did not consist in any of these respects then in what did it consist  matthew was haunted by this question long after the girls had gone arm in arm down the long hard frozen lane and anne had betaken herself to her books he could not refer it to marilla who he felt would be quite sure to sniff scornfully and remark that the only difference she saw between anne and the other girls was that they sometimes kept their tongues quiet while anne never did this matthew felt would be no great help  he had recourse to his pipe that evening to help him study it out much to marillas disgust after two hours of smoking and hard reflection matthew arrived at a solution of his problem anne was not dressed like the other girls  the more matthew thought about the matter the more he was convinced that anne never had been dressed like the other girls never since she had come to green gables marilla kept her clothed in plain dark dresses all made after the same unvarying pattern if matthew knew there was such a thing as fashion in dress it was as much as he did but he was quite sure that annes sleeves did not look at all like the sleeves the other girls wore he recalled the cluster of little girls he had seen around her that evening all gay in waists of red and blue and pink and white and he wondered why marilla always kept her so plainly and soberly gowned  of course it must be all right marilla knew best and marilla was bringing her up probably some wise inscrutable motive was to be served thereby but surely it would do no harm to let the child have one pretty dress something like diana barry always wore matthew decided that he would give her one that surely could not be objected to as an unwarranted putting in of his oar christmas was only a fortnight off a nice new dress would be the very thing for a present matthew with a sigh of satisfaction put away his pipe and went to bed while marilla opened all the doors and aired the house  the very next evening matthew betook himself to carmody to buy the dress determined to get the worst over and have done with it it would be he felt assured no trifling ordeal there were some things matthew could buy and prove himself no mean bargainer but he knew he would be at the mercy of shopkeepers when it came to buying a girls dress  after much cogitation matthew resolved to go to samuel lawsons store instead of william blairs to be sure the cuthberts always had gone to william blairs it was almost as much a matter of conscience with them as to attend the presbyterian church and vote conservative but william blairs two daughters frequently waited on customers there and matthew held them in absolute dread he could contrive to deal with them when he knew exactly what he wanted and could point it out but in such a matter as this requiring explanation and consultation matthew felt that he must be sure of a man behind the counter so he would go to lawsons where samuel or his son would wait on him  alas matthew did not know that samuel in the recent expansion of his business had set up a lady clerk also she was a niece of his wifes and a very dashing young person indeed with a huge drooping pompadour big rolling brown eyes and a most extensive and bewildering smile she was dressed with exceeding smartness and wore several bangle bracelets that glittered and rattled and tinkled with every movement of her hands matthew was covered with confusion at finding her there at all and those bangles completely wrecked his wits at one fell swoop  what can i do for you this evening mr cuthbert miss lucilla harris inquired briskly and ingratiatingly tapping the counter with both hands  have you any any any well now say any garden rakes stammered matthew  miss harris looked somewhat surprised as well she might to hear a man inquiring for garden rakes in the middle of december  i believe we have one or two left over she said but theyre upstairs in the lumber room ill go and see during her absence matthew collected his scattered senses for another effort  when miss harris returned with the rake and cheerfully inquired  anything else tonight mr cuthbert matthew took his courage in both hands and replied  well now since you suggest it i might as well take that is look at buy some some hayseed  miss harris had heard matthew cuthbert called odd she now concluded that he was entirely crazy  we only keep hayseed in the spring she explained loftily weve none on hand just now  oh certainly certainly just as you say stammered unhappy matthew seizing the rake and making for the door at the threshold he recollected that he had not paid for it and he turned miserably back while miss harris was counting out his change he rallied his powers for a final desperate attempt  well now if it isnt too much trouble i might as well that is id like to look at at some sugar  white or brown queried miss harris patiently  oh well now brown said matthew feebly  theres a barrel of it over there said miss harris shaking her bangles at it its the only kind we have  ill ill take twenty pounds of it said matthew with beads of perspiration standing on his forehead  matthew had driven halfway home before he was his own man again it had been a gruesome experience but it served him right he thought for committing the heresy of going to a strange store when he reached home he hid the rake in the tool house but the sugar he carried in to marilla  brown sugar exclaimed marilla whatever possessed you to get so much you know i never use it except for the hired mans porridge or black fruit cake jerrys gone and ive made my cake long ago its not good sugar either its coarse and dark william blair doesnt usually keep sugar like that  i i thought it might come in handy sometime said matthew making good his escape  when matthew came to think the matter over he decided that a woman was required to cope with the situation marilla was out of the question matthew felt sure she would throw cold water on his project at once remained only mrs lynde for of no other woman in avonlea would matthew have dared to ask advice to mrs lynde he went accordingly and that good lady promptly took the matter out of the harassed mans hands  pick out a dress for you to give anne to be sure i will im going to carmody tomorrow and ill attend to it have you something particular in mind no well ill just go by my own judgment then i believe a nice rich brown would just suit anne and william blair has some new gloria in thats real pretty perhaps youd like me to make it up for her too seeing that if marilla was to make it anne would probably get wind of it before the time and spoil the surprise well ill do it no it isnt a mite of trouble i like sewing ill make it to fit my niece jenny gillis for she and anne are as like as two peas as far as figure goes  well now im much obliged said matthew and and i dunno but id like i think they make the sleeves different nowadays to what they used to be if it wouldnt be asking too much i id like them made in the new way  puffs of course you neednt worry a speck more about it matthew ill make it up in the very latest fashion said mrs lynde to herself she added when matthew had gone   itll be a real satisfaction to see that poor child wearing something decent for once the way marilla dresses her is positively ridiculous thats what and ive ached to tell her so plainly a dozen times ive held my tongue though for i can see marilla doesnt want advice and she thinks she knows more about bringing children up than i do for all shes an old maid but thats always the way folks that has brought up children know that theres no hard and fast method in the world thatll suit every child but them as never have think its all as plain and easy as rule of three just set your three terms down so fashion and the sum ‘ll work out correct but flesh and blood dont come under the head of arithmetic and thats where marilla cuthbert makes her mistake i suppose shes trying to cultivate a spirit of humility in anne by dressing her as she does but its more likely to cultivate envy and discontent im sure the child must feel the difference between her clothes and the other girls but to think of matthew taking notice of it that man is waking up after being asleep for over sixty years  marilla knew all the following fortnight that matthew had something on his mind but what it was she could not guess until christmas eve when mrs lynde brought up the new dress marilla behaved pretty well on the whole although it is very likely she distrusted mrs lyndes diplomatic explanation that she had made the dress because matthew was afraid anne would find out about it too soon if marilla made it  so this is what matthew has been looking so mysterious over and grinning about to himself for two weeks is it she said a little stiffly but tolerantly i knew he was up to some foolishness well i must say i dont think anne needed any more dresses i made her three good warm serviceable ones this fall and anything more is sheer extravagance theres enough material in those sleeves alone to make a waist i declare there is youll just pamper annes vanity matthew and shes as vain as a peacock now well i hope shell be satisfied at last for i know shes been hankering after those silly sleeves ever since they came in although she never said a word after the first the puffs have been getting bigger and more ridiculous right along theyre as big as balloons now next year anybody who wears them will have to go through a door sideways  christmas morning broke on a beautiful white world it had been a very mild december and people had looked forward to a green christmas but just enough snow fell softly in the night to transfigure avonlea anne peeped out from her frosted gable window with delighted eyes the firs in the haunted wood were all feathery and wonderful the birches and wild cherry trees were outlined in pearl the plowed fields were stretches of snowy dimples and there was a crisp tang in the air that was glorious anne ran downstairs singing until her voice reechoed through green gables  merry christmas marilla merry christmas matthew isnt it a lovely christmas im so glad its white any other kind of christmas doesnt seem real does it i dont like green christmases theyre not green theyre just nasty faded browns and grays what makes people call them green why why matthew is that for me oh matthew  matthew had sheepishly unfolded the dress from its paper swathings and held it out with a deprecatory glance at marilla who feigned to be contemptuously filling the teapot but nevertheless watched the scene out of the corner of her eye with a rather interested air  anne took the dress and looked at it in reverent silence oh how pretty it was a lovely soft brown gloria with all the gloss of silk a skirt with dainty frills and shirrings a waist elaborately pintucked in the most fashionable way with a little ruffle of filmy lace at the neck but the sleeves they were the crowning glory long elbow cuffs and above them two beautiful puffs divided by rows of shirring and bows of brown silk ribbon  thats a christmas present for you anne said matthew shyly why why anne dont you like it well now well now  for annes eyes had suddenly filled with tears  like it oh matthew anne laid the dress over a chair and clasped her hands matthew its perfectly exquisite oh i can never thank you enough look at those sleeves oh it seems to me this must be a happy dream  well well let us have breakfast interrupted marilla i must say anne i dont think you needed the dress but since matthew has got it for you see that you take good care of it theres a hair ribbon mrs lynde left for you its brown to match the dress come now sit in  i dont see how im going to eat breakfast said anne rapturously breakfast seems so commonplace at such an exciting moment id rather feast my eyes on that dress im so glad that puffed sleeves are still fashionable it did seem to me that id never get over it if they went out before i had a dress with them id never have felt quite satisfied you see it was lovely of mrs lynde to give me the ribbon too i feel that i ought to be a very good girl indeed its at times like this im sorry im not a model little girl and i always resolve that i will be in future but somehow its hard to carry out your resolutions when irresistible temptations come still i really will make an extra effort after this  when the commonplace breakfast was over diana appeared crossing the white log bridge in the hollow a gay little figure in her crimson ulster anne flew down the slope to meet her  merry christmas diana and oh its a wonderful christmas ive something splendid to show you matthew has given me the loveliest dress with such sleeves i couldnt even imagine any nicer  ive got something more for you said diana breathlessly here this box aunt josephine sent us out a big box with ever so many things in it and this is for you id have brought it over last night but it didnt come until after dark and i never feel very comfortable coming through the haunted wood in the dark now  anne opened the box and peeped in first a card with for the anne girl and merry christmas written on it and then a pair of the daintiest little kid slippers with beaded toes and satin bows and glistening buckles  oh said anne diana this is too much i must be dreaming  i call it providential said diana you wont have to borrow rubys slippers now and thats a blessing for theyre two sizes too big for you and it would be awful to hear a fairy shuffling josie pye would be delighted mind you rob wright went home with gertie pye from the practice night before last did you ever hear anything equal to that  all the avonlea scholars were in a fever of excitement that day for the hall had to be decorated and a last grand rehearsal held  the concert came off in the evening and was a pronounced success the little hall was crowded all the performers did excellently well but anne was the bright particular star of the occasion as even envy in the shape of josie pye dared not deny  oh hasnt it been a brilliant evening sighed anne when it was all over and she and diana were walking home together under a dark starry sky  everything went off very well said diana practically i guess we must have made as much as ten dollars mind you mr allan is going to send an account of it to the charlottetown papers  oh diana will we really see our names in print it makes me thrill to think of it your solo was perfectly elegant diana i felt prouder than you did when it was encored i just said to myself ‘it is my dear bosom friend who is so honored  well your recitations just brought down the house anne that sad one was simply splendid  oh i was so nervous diana when mr allan called out my name i really cannot tell how i ever got up on that platform i felt as if a million eyes were looking at me and through me and for one dreadful moment i was sure i couldnt begin at all then i thought of my lovely puffed sleeves and took courage i knew that i must live up to those sleeves diana so i started in and my voice seemed to be coming from ever so far away i just felt like a parrot its providential that i practiced those recitations so often up in the garret or id never have been able to get through did i groan all right  yes indeed you groaned lovely assured diana  i saw old mrs sloane wiping away tears when i sat down it was splendid to think i had touched somebodys heart its so romantic to take part in a concert isnt it oh its been a very memorable occasion indeed  wasnt the boys dialogue fine said diana gilbert blythe was just splendid anne i do think its awful mean the way you treat gil wait till i tell you when you ran off the platform after the fairy dialogue one of your roses fell out of your hair i saw gil pick it up and put it in his breast pocket there now youre so romantic that im sure you ought to be pleased at that  its nothing to me what that person does said anne loftily i simply never waste a thought on him diana  that night marilla and matthew who had been out to a concert for the first time in twenty years sat for a while by the kitchen fire after anne had gone to bed  well now i guess our anne did as well as any of them said matthew proudly  yes she did admitted marilla shes a bright child matthew and she looked real nice too ive been kind of opposed to this concert scheme but i suppose theres no real harm in it after all anyhow i was proud of anne tonight although im not going to tell her so  well now i was proud of her and i did tell her so ‘fore she went upstairs said matthew we must see what we can do for her some of these days marilla i guess shell need something more than avonlea school by and by  theres time enough to think of that said marilla shes only thirteen in march though tonight it struck me she was growing quite a big girl mrs lynde made that dress a mite too long and it makes anne look so tall shes quick to learn and i guess the best thing we can do for her will be to send her to queens after a spell but nothing need be said about that for a year or two yet  well now itll do no harm to be thinking it over off and on said matthew things like that are all the better for lots of thinking over     chapter xxvi the story club is formed   junior avonlea found it hard to settle down to humdrum existence again to anne in particular things seemed fearfully flat stale and unprofitable after the goblet of excitement she had been sipping for weeks could she go back to the former quiet pleasures of those faraway days before the concert at first as she told diana she did not really think she could  im positively certain diana that life can never be quite the same again as it was in those olden days she said mournfully as if referring to a period of at least fifty years back perhaps after a while ill get used to it but im afraid concerts spoil people for everyday life i suppose that is why marilla disapproves of them marilla is such a sensible woman it must be a great deal better to be sensible but still i dont believe id really want to be a sensible person because they are so unromantic mrs lynde says there is no danger of my ever being one but you can never tell i feel just now that i may grow up to be sensible yet but perhaps that is only because im tired i simply couldnt sleep last night for ever so long i just lay awake and imagined the concert over and over again thats one splendid thing about such affairs its so lovely to look back to them  eventually however avonlea school slipped back into its old groove and took up its old interests to be sure the concert left traces ruby gillis and emma white who had quarreled over a point of precedence in their platform seats no longer sat at the same desk and a promising friendship of three years was broken up josie pye and julia bell did not speak for three months because josie pye had told bessie wright that julia bells bow when she got up to recite made her think of a chicken jerking its head and bessie told julia none of the sloanes would have any dealings with the bells because the bells had declared that the sloanes had too much to do in the program and the sloanes had retorted that the bells were not capable of doing the little they had to do properly finally charlie sloane fought moody spurgeon macpherson because moody spurgeon had said that anne shirley put on airs about her recitations and moody spurgeon was licked consequently moody spurgeons sister ella may would not speak to anne shirley all the rest of the winter with the exception of these trifling frictions work in miss stacys little kingdom went on with regularity and smoothness  the winter weeks slipped by it was an unusually mild winter with so little snow that anne and diana could go to school nearly every day by way of the birch path on annes birthday they were tripping lightly down it keeping eyes and ears alert amid all their chatter for miss stacy had told them that they must soon write a composition on a winters walk in the woods and it behooved them to be observant  just think diana im thirteen years old today remarked anne in an awed voice i can scarcely realize that im in my teens when i woke this morning it seemed to me that everything must be different youve been thirteen for a month so i suppose it doesnt seem such a novelty to you as it does to me it makes life seem so much more interesting in two more years ill be really grown up its a great comfort to think that ill be able to use big words then without being laughed at  ruby gillis says she means to have a beau as soon as shes fifteen  said diana  ruby gillis thinks of nothing but beaus said anne disdainfully shes actually delighted when anyone writes her name up in a take notice for all she pretends to be so mad but im afraid that is an uncharitable speech mrs allan says we should never make uncharitable speeches but they do slip out so often before you think dont they i simply cant talk about josie pye without making an uncharitable speech so i never mention her at all you may have noticed that im trying to be as much like mrs allan as i possibly can for i think shes perfect mr allan thinks so too mrs lynde says he just worships the ground she treads on and she doesnt really think it right for a minister to set his affections so much on a mortal being but then diana even ministers are human and have their besetting sins just like everybody else i had such an interesting talk with mrs allan about besetting sins last sunday afternoon there are just a few things its proper to talk about on sundays and that is one of them my besetting sin is imagining too much and forgetting my duties im striving very hard to overcome it and now that im really thirteen perhaps ill get on better  in four more years well be able to put our hair up said diana alice bell is only sixteen and she is wearing hers up but i think thats ridiculous i shall wait until im seventeen  if i had alice bells crooked nose said anne decidedly i wouldnt but there i wont say what i was going to because it was extremely uncharitable besides i was comparing it with my own nose and thats vanity im afraid i think too much about my nose ever since i heard that compliment about it long ago it really is a great comfort to me oh diana look theres a rabbit thats something to remember for our woods composition i really think the woods are just as lovely in winter as in summer theyre so white and still as if they were asleep and dreaming pretty dreams  i wont mind writing that composition when its time comes sighed diana i can manage to write about the woods but the one were to hand in monday is terrible the idea of miss stacy telling us to write a story out of our own heads  why its as easy as wink said anne  its easy for you because you have an imagination retorted diana but what would you do if you had been born without one i suppose you have your composition all done  anne nodded trying hard not to look virtuously complacent and failing miserably  i wrote it last monday evening its called ‘the jealous rival or in death not divided i read it to marilla and she said it was stuff and nonsense then i read it to matthew and he said it was fine that is the kind of critic i like its a sad sweet story i just cried like a child while i was writing it its about two beautiful maidens called cordelia montmorency and geraldine seymour who lived in the same village and were devotedly attached to each other cordelia was a regal brunette with a coronet of midnight hair and duskly flashing eyes geraldine was a queenly blonde with hair like spun gold and velvety purple eyes  i never saw anybody with purple eyes said diana dubiously  neither did i i just imagined them i wanted something out of the common geraldine had an alabaster brow too ive found out what an alabaster brow is that is one of the advantages of being thirteen you know so much more than you did when you were only twelve  well what became of cordelia and geraldine asked diana who was beginning to feel rather interested in their fate  they grew in beauty side by side until they were sixteen then bertram devere came to their native village and fell in love with the fair geraldine he saved her life when her horse ran away with her in a carriage and she fainted in his arms and he carried her home three miles because you understand the carriage was all smashed up i found it rather hard to imagine the proposal because i had no experience to go by i asked ruby gillis if she knew anything about how men proposed because i thought shed likely be an authority on the subject having so many sisters married ruby told me she was hid in the hall pantry when malcolm andres proposed to her sister susan she said malcolm told susan that his dad had given him the farm in his own name and then said ‘what do you say darling pet if we get hitched this fall and susan said ‘yes no i dont know let me see and there they were engaged as quick as that but i didnt think that sort of a proposal was a very romantic one so in the end i had to imagine it out as well as i could i made it very flowery and poetical and bertram went on his knees although ruby gillis says it isnt done nowadays geraldine accepted him in a speech a page long i can tell you i took a lot of trouble with that speech i rewrote it five times and i look upon it as my masterpiece bertram gave her a diamond ring and a ruby necklace and told her they would go to europe for a wedding tour for he was immensely wealthy but then alas shadows began to darken over their path cordelia was secretly in love with bertram herself and when geraldine told her about the engagement she was simply furious especially when she saw the necklace and the diamond ring all her affection for geraldine turned to bitter hate and she vowed that she should never marry bertram but she pretended to be geraldines friend the same as ever one evening they were standing on the bridge over a rushing turbulent stream and cordelia thinking they were alone pushed geraldine over the brink with a wild mocking ‘ha ha ha but bertram saw it all and he at once plunged into the current exclaiming ‘i will save thee my peerless geraldine but alas he had forgotten he couldnt swim and they were both drowned clasped in each others arms their bodies were washed ashore soon afterwards they were buried in the one grave and their funeral was most imposing diana its so much more romantic to end a story up with a funeral than a wedding as for cordelia she went insane with remorse and was shut up in a lunatic asylum i thought that was a poetical retribution for her crime  how perfectly lovely sighed diana who belonged to matthews school of critics i dont see how you can make up such thrilling things out of your own head anne i wish my imagination was as good as yours  it would be if youd only cultivate it said anne cheeringly ive just thought of a plan diana let you and me have a story club all our own and write stories for practice ill help you along until you can do them by yourself you ought to cultivate your imagination you know miss stacy says so only we must take the right way i told her about the haunted wood but she said we went the wrong way about it in that  this was how the story club came into existence it was limited to diana and anne at first but soon it was extended to include jane andrews and ruby gillis and one or two others who felt that their imaginations needed cultivating no boys were allowed in it although ruby gillis opined that their admission would make it more exciting and each member had to produce one story a week  its extremely interesting anne told marilla each girl has to read her story out loud and then we talk it over we are going to keep them all sacredly and have them to read to our descendants we each write under a nom de plume mine is rosamond montmorency all the girls do pretty well ruby gillis is rather sentimental she puts too much lovemaking into her stories and you know too much is worse than too little jane never puts any because she says it makes her feel so silly when she had to read it out loud janes stories are extremely sensible then diana puts too many murders into hers she says most of the time she doesnt know what to do with the people so she kills them off to get rid of them i mostly always have to tell them what to write about but that isnt hard for ive millions of ideas  i think this story writing business is the foolishest yet scoffed marilla youll get a pack of nonsense into your heads and waste time that should be put on your lessons reading stories is bad enough but writing them is worse  but were so careful to put a moral into them all marilla explained anne i insist upon that all the good people are rewarded and all the bad ones are suitably punished im sure that must have a wholesome effect the moral is the great thing mr allan says so i read one of my stories to him and mrs allan and they both agreed that the moral was excellent only they laughed in the wrong places i like it better when people cry jane and ruby almost always cry when i come to the pathetic parts diana wrote her aunt josephine about our club and her aunt josephine wrote back that we were to send her some of our stories so we copied out four of our very best and sent them miss josephine barry wrote back that she had never read anything so amusing in her life that kind of puzzled us because the stories were all very pathetic and almost everybody died but im glad miss barry liked them it shows our club is doing some good in the world mrs allan says that ought to be our object in everything i do really try to make it my object but i forget so often when im having fun i hope i shall be a little like mrs allan when i grow up do you think there is any prospect of it marilla  i shouldnt say there was a great deal was marillas encouraging answer im sure mrs allan was never such a silly forgetful little girl as you are  no but she wasnt always so good as she is now either said anne seriously she told me so herself that is she said she was a dreadful mischief when she was a girl and was always getting into scrapes i felt so encouraged when i heard that is it very wicked of me marilla to feel encouraged when i hear that other people have been bad and mischievous mrs lynde says it is mrs lynde says she always feels shocked when she hears of anyone ever having been naughty no matter how small they were mrs lynde says she once heard a minister confess that when he was a boy he stole a strawberry tart out of his aunts pantry and she never had any respect for that minister again now i wouldnt have felt that way id have thought that it was real noble of him to confess it and id have thought what an encouraging thing it would be for small boys nowadays who do naughty things and are sorry for them to know that perhaps they may grow up to be ministers in spite of it thats how id feel marilla  the way i feel at present anne said marilla is that its high time you had those dishes washed youve taken half an hour longer than you should with all your chattering learn to work first and talk afterwards     chapter xxvii vanity and vexation of spirit   marilla walking home one late april evening from an aid meeting realized that the winter was over and gone with the thrill of delight that spring never fails to bring to the oldest and saddest as well as to the youngest and merriest marilla was not given to subjective analysis of her thoughts and feelings she probably imagined that she was thinking about the aids and their missionary box and the new carpet for the vestry room but under these reflections was a harmonious consciousness of red fields smoking into pale purply mists in the declining sun of long sharp pointed fir shadows falling over the meadow beyond the brook of still crimson budded maples around a mirrorlike wood pool of a wakening in the world and a stir of hidden pulses under the gray sod the spring was abroad in the land and marillas sober middle aged step was lighter and swifter because of its deep primal gladness  her eyes dwelt affectionately on green gables peering through its network of trees and reflecting the sunlight back from its windows in several little coruscations of glory marilla as she picked her steps along the damp lane thought that it was really a satisfaction to know that she was going home to a briskly snapping wood fire and a table nicely spread for tea instead of to the cold comfort of old aid meeting evenings before anne had come to green gables  consequently when marilla entered her kitchen and found the fire black out with no sign of anne anywhere she felt justly disappointed and irritated she had told anne to be sure and have tea ready at five oclock but now she must hurry to take off her second best dress and prepare the meal herself against matthews return from plowing  ill settle miss anne when she comes home said marilla grimly as she shaved up kindlings with a carving knife and with more vim than was strictly necessary matthew had come in and was waiting patiently for his tea in his corner shes gadding off somewhere with diana writing stories or practicing dialogues or some such tomfoolery and never thinking once about the time or her duties shes just got to be pulled up short and sudden on this sort of thing i dont care if mrs allan does say shes the brightest and sweetest child she ever knew she may be bright and sweet enough but her head is full of nonsense and theres never any knowing what shape itll break out in next just as soon as she grows out of one freak she takes up with another but there here i am saying the very thing i was so riled with rachel lynde for saying at the aid today i was real glad when mrs allan spoke up for anne for if she hadnt i know id have said something too sharp to rachel before everybody annes got plenty of faults goodness knows and far be it from me to deny it but im bringing her up and not rachel lynde whod pick faults in the angel gabriel himself if he lived in avonlea just the same anne has no business to leave the house like this when i told her she was to stay home this afternoon and look after things i must say with all her faults i never found her disobedient or untrustworthy before and im real sorry to find her so now  well now i dunno said matthew who being patient and wise and above all hungry had deemed it best to let marilla talk her wrath out unhindered having learned by experience that she got through with whatever work was on hand much quicker if not delayed by untimely argument perhaps youre judging her too hasty marilla dont call her untrustworthy until youre sure she has disobeyed you mebbe it can all be explained annes a great hand at explaining  shes not here when i told her to stay retorted marilla i reckon shell find it hard to explain that to my satisfaction of course i knew youd take her part matthew but im bringing her up not you  it was dark when supper was ready and still no sign of anne coming hurriedly over the log bridge or up lovers lane breathless and repentant with a sense of neglected duties marilla washed and put away the dishes grimly then wanting a candle to light her way down the cellar she went up to the east gable for the one that generally stood on annes table lighting it she turned around to see anne herself lying on the bed face downward among the pillows  mercy on us said astonished marilla have you been asleep anne  no was the muffled reply  are you sick then demanded marilla anxiously going over to the bed  anne cowered deeper into her pillows as if desirous of hiding herself forever from mortal eyes  no but please marilla go away and dont look at me im in the depths of despair and i dont care who gets head in class or writes the best composition or sings in the sunday school choir any more little things like that are of no importance now because i dont suppose ill ever be able to go anywhere again my career is closed please marilla go away and dont look at me  did anyone ever hear the like the mystified marilla wanted to know anne shirley whatever is the matter with you what have you done get right up this minute and tell me this minute i say there now what is it  anne had slid to the floor in despairing obedience  look at my hair marilla she whispered  accordingly marilla lifted her candle and looked scrutinizingly at annes hair flowing in heavy masses down her back it certainly had a very strange appearance  anne shirley what have you done to your hair why its green  green it might be called if it were any earthly color a queer dull bronzy green with streaks here and there of the original red to heighten the ghastly effect never in all her life had marilla seen anything so grotesque as annes hair at that moment  yes its green moaned anne i thought nothing could be as bad as red hair but now i know its ten times worse to have green hair oh marilla you little know how utterly wretched i am  i little know how you got into this fix but i mean to find out said marilla come right down to the kitchen its too cold up here and tell me just what youve done ive been expecting something queer for some time you havent got into any scrape for over two months and i was sure another one was due now then what did you do to your hair  i dyed it  dyed it dyed your hair anne shirley didnt you know it was a wicked thing to do  yes i knew it was a little wicked admitted anne but i thought it was worth while to be a little wicked to get rid of red hair i counted the cost marilla besides i meant to be extra good in other ways to make up for it  well said marilla sarcastically if id decided it was worth while to dye my hair id have dyed it a decent color at least i wouldnt have dyed it green  but i didnt mean to dye it green marilla protested anne dejectedly if i was wicked i meant to be wicked to some purpose he said it would turn my hair a beautiful raven black he positively assured me that it would how could i doubt his word marilla i know what it feels like to have your word doubted and mrs allan says we should never suspect anyone of not telling us the truth unless we have proof that theyre not i have proof now green hair is proof enough for anybody but i hadnt then and i believed every word he said implicitly  who said who are you talking about  the peddler that was here this afternoon i bought the dye from him  anne shirley how often have i told you never to let one of those italians in the house i dont believe in encouraging them to come around at all  oh i didnt let him in the house i remembered what you told me and i went out carefully shut the door and looked at his things on the step besides he wasnt an italian he was a german jew he had a big box full of very interesting things and he told me he was working hard to make enough money to bring his wife and children out from germany he spoke so feelingly about them that it touched my heart i wanted to buy something from him to help him in such a worthy object then all at once i saw the bottle of hair dye the peddler said it was warranted to dye any hair a beautiful raven black and wouldnt wash off in a trice i saw myself with beautiful raven black hair and the temptation was irresistible but the price of the bottle was seventy five cents and i had only fifty cents left out of my chicken money i think the peddler had a very kind heart for he said that seeing it was me hed sell it for fifty cents and that was just giving it away so i bought it and as soon as he had gone i came up here and applied it with an old hairbrush as the directions said i used up the whole bottle and oh marilla when i saw the dreadful color it turned my hair i repented of being wicked i can tell you and ive been repenting ever since  well i hope youll repent to good purpose said marilla severely and that youve got your eyes opened to where your vanity has led you anne goodness knows whats to be done i suppose the first thing is to give your hair a good washing and see if that will do any good  accordingly anne washed her hair scrubbing it vigorously with soap and water but for all the difference it made she might as well have been scouring its original red the peddler had certainly spoken the truth when he declared that the dye wouldnt wash off however his veracity might be impeached in other respects  oh marilla what shall i do questioned anne in tears i can never live this down people have pretty well forgotten my other mistakes the liniment cake and setting diana drunk and flying into a temper with mrs lynde but theyll never forget this they will think i am not respectable oh marilla ‘what a tangled web we weave when first we practice to deceive that is poetry but it is true and oh how josie pye will laugh marilla i cannot face josie pye i am the unhappiest girl in prince edward island  annes unhappiness continued for a week during that time she went nowhere and shampooed her hair every day diana alone of outsiders knew the fatal secret but she promised solemnly never to tell and it may be stated here and now that she kept her word at the end of the week marilla said decidedly   its no use anne that is fast dye if ever there was any your hair must be cut off there is no other way you cant go out with it looking like that  annes lips quivered but she realized the bitter truth of marillas remarks with a dismal sigh she went for the scissors  please cut it off at once marilla and have it over oh i feel that my heart is broken this is such an unromantic affliction the girls in books lose their hair in fevers or sell it to get money for some good deed and im sure i wouldnt mind losing my hair in some such fashion half so much but there is nothing comforting in having your hair cut off because youve dyed it a dreadful color is there im going to weep all the time youre cutting it off if it wont interfere it seems such a tragic thing  anne wept then but later on when she went upstairs and looked in the glass she was calm with despair marilla had done her work thoroughly and it had been necessary to shingle the hair as closely as possible the result was not becoming to state the case as mildly as may be anne promptly turned her glass to the wall  ill never never look at myself again until my hair grows she exclaimed passionately  then she suddenly righted the glass  yes i will too id do penance for being wicked that way ill look at myself every time i come to my room and see how ugly i am and i wont try to imagine it away either i never thought i was vain about my hair of all things but now i know i was in spite of its being red because it was so long and thick and curly i expect something will happen to my nose next  annes clipped head made a sensation in school on the following monday but to her relief nobody guessed the real reason for it not even josie pye who however did not fail to inform anne that she looked like a perfect scarecrow  i didnt say anything when josie said that to me anne confided that evening to marilla who was lying on the sofa after one of her headaches because i thought it was part of my punishment and i ought to bear it patiently its hard to be told you look like a scarecrow and i wanted to say something back but i didnt i just swept her one scornful look and then i forgave her it makes you feel very virtuous when you forgive people doesnt it i mean to devote all my energies to being good after this and i shall never try to be beautiful again of course its better to be good i know it is but its sometimes so hard to believe a thing even when you know it i do really want to be good marilla like you and mrs allan and miss stacy and grow up to be a credit to you diana says when my hair begins to grow to tie a black velvet ribbon around my head with a bow at one side she says she thinks it will be very becoming i will call it a snood that sounds so romantic but am i talking too much marilla does it hurt your head  my head is better now it was terrible bad this afternoon though these headaches of mine are getting worse and worse ill have to see a doctor about them as for your chatter i dont know that i mind it ive got so used to it  which was marillas way of saying that she liked to hear it     chapter xxviii an unfortunate lily maid   of course you must be elaine anne said diana i could never have the courage to float down there  nor i said ruby gillis with a shiver i dont mind floating down when theres two or three of us in the flat and we can sit up its fun then but to lie down and pretend i was dead i just couldnt id die really of fright  of course it would be romantic conceded jane andrews but i know i couldnt keep still id be popping up every minute or so to see where i was and if i wasnt drifting too far out and you know anne that would spoil the effect  but its so ridiculous to have a redheaded elaine mourned anne im not afraid to float down and id love to be elaine but its ridiculous just the same ruby ought to be elaine because she is so fair and has such lovely long golden hair elaine had ‘all her bright hair streaming down you know and elaine was the lily maid now a red haired person cannot be a lily maid  your complexion is just as fair as rubys said diana earnestly and your hair is ever so much darker than it used to be before you cut it  oh do you really think so exclaimed anne flushing sensitively with delight ive sometimes thought it was myself but i never dared to ask anyone for fear she would tell me it wasnt do you think it could be called auburn now diana  yes and i think it is real pretty said diana looking admiringly at the short silky curls that clustered over annes head and were held in place by a very jaunty black velvet ribbon and bow  they were standing on the bank of the pond below orchard slope where a little headland fringed with birches ran out from the bank at its tip was a small wooden platform built out into the water for the convenience of fishermen and duck hunters ruby and jane were spending the midsummer afternoon with diana and anne had come over to play with them  anne and diana had spent most of their playtime that summer on and about the pond idlewild was a thing of the past mr bell having ruthlessly cut down the little circle of trees in his back pasture in the spring anne had sat among the stumps and wept not without an eye to the romance of it but she was speedily consoled for after all as she and diana said big girls of thirteen going on fourteen were too old for such childish amusements as playhouses and there were more fascinating sports to be found about the pond it was splendid to fish for trout over the bridge and the two girls learned to row themselves about in the little flat bottomed dory mr barry kept for duck shooting  it was annes idea that they dramatize elaine they had studied tennysons poem in school the preceding winter the superintendent of education having prescribed it in the english course for the prince edward island schools they had analyzed and parsed it and torn it to pieces in general until it was a wonder there was any meaning at all left in it for them but at least the fair lily maid and lancelot and guinevere and king arthur had become very real people to them and anne was devoured by secret regret that she had not been born in camelot those days she said were so much more romantic than the present  annes plan was hailed with enthusiasm the girls had discovered that if the flat were pushed off from the landing place it would drift down with the current under the bridge and finally strand itself on another headland lower down which ran out at a curve in the pond they had often gone down like this and nothing could be more convenient for playing elaine  well ill be elaine said anne yielding reluctantly for although she would have been delighted to play the principal character yet her artistic sense demanded fitness for it and this she felt her limitations made impossible ruby you must be king arthur and jane will be guinevere and diana must be lancelot but first you must be the brothers and the father we cant have the old dumb servitor because there isnt room for two in the flat when one is lying down we must pall the barge all its length in blackest samite that old black shawl of your mothers will be just the thing diana  the black shawl having been procured anne spread it over the flat and then lay down on the bottom with closed eyes and hands folded over her breast  oh she does look really dead whispered ruby gillis nervously watching the still white little face under the flickering shadows of the birches it makes me feel frightened girls do you suppose its really right to act like this mrs lynde says that all play acting is abominably wicked  ruby you shouldnt talk about mrs lynde said anne severely it spoils the effect because this is hundreds of years before mrs lynde was born jane you arrange this its silly for elaine to be talking when shes dead  jane rose to the occasion cloth of gold for coverlet there was none but an old piano scarf of yellow japanese crepe was an excellent substitute a white lily was not obtainable just then but the effect of a tall blue iris placed in one of annes folded hands was all that could be desired  now shes all ready said jane we must kiss her quiet brows and diana you say ‘sister farewell forever and ruby you say ‘farewell sweet sister both of you as sorrowfully as you possibly can anne for goodness sake smile a little you know elaine ‘lay as though she smiled thats better now push the flat off  the flat was accordingly pushed off scraping roughly over an old embedded stake in the process diana and jane and ruby only waited long enough to see it caught in the current and headed for the bridge before scampering up through the woods across the road and down to the lower headland where as lancelot and guinevere and the king they were to be in readiness to receive the lily maid  for a few minutes anne drifting slowly down enjoyed the romance of her situation to the full then something happened not at all romantic the flat began to leak in a very few moments it was necessary for elaine to scramble to her feet pick up her cloth of gold coverlet and pall of blackest samite and gaze blankly at a big crack in the bottom of her barge through which the water was literally pouring that sharp stake at the landing had torn off the strip of batting nailed on the flat anne did not know this but it did not take her long to realize that she was in a dangerous plight at this rate the flat would fill and sink long before it could drift to the lower headland where were the oars left behind at the landing  anne gave one gasping little scream which nobody ever heard she was white to the lips but she did not lose her self possession there was one chance just one  i was horribly frightened she told mrs allan the next day and it seemed like years while the flat was drifting down to the bridge and the water rising in it every moment i prayed mrs allan most earnestly but i didnt shut my eyes to pray for i knew the only way god could save me was to let the flat float close enough to one of the bridge piles for me to climb up on it you know the piles are just old tree trunks and there are lots of knots and old branch stubs on them it was proper to pray but i had to do my part by watching out and right well i knew it i just said ‘dear god please take the flat close to a pile and ill do the rest over and over again under such circumstances you dont think much about making a flowery prayer but mine was answered for the flat bumped right into a pile for a minute and i flung the scarf and the shawl over my shoulder and scrambled up on a big providential stub and there i was mrs allan clinging to that slippery old pile with no way of getting up or down it was a very unromantic position but i didnt think about that at the time you dont think much about romance when you have just escaped from a watery grave i said a grateful prayer at once and then i gave all my attention to holding on tight for i knew i should probably have to depend on human aid to get back to dry land  the flat drifted under the bridge and then promptly sank in midstream ruby jane and diana already awaiting it on the lower headland saw it disappear before their very eyes and had not a doubt but that anne had gone down with it for a moment they stood still white as sheets frozen with horror at the tragedy then shrieking at the tops of their voices they started on a frantic run up through the woods never pausing as they crossed the main road to glance the way of the bridge anne clinging desperately to her precarious foothold saw their flying forms and heard their shrieks help would soon come but meanwhile her position was a very uncomfortable one  the minutes passed by each seeming an hour to the unfortunate lily maid why didnt somebody come where had the girls gone suppose they had fainted one and all suppose nobody ever came suppose she grew so tired and cramped that she could hold on no longer anne looked at the wicked green depths below her wavering with long oily shadows and shivered her imagination began to suggest all manner of gruesome possibilities to her  then just as she thought she really could not endure the ache in her arms and wrists another moment gilbert blythe came rowing under the bridge in harmon andrewss dory  gilbert glanced up and much to his amazement beheld a little white scornful face looking down upon him with big frightened but also scornful gray eyes  anne shirley how on earth did you get there he exclaimed  without waiting for an answer he pulled close to the pile and extended his hand there was no help for it anne clinging to gilbert blythes hand scrambled down into the dory where she sat drabbled and furious in the stern with her arms full of dripping shawl and wet crepe it was certainly extremely difficult to be dignified under the circumstances  what has happened anne asked gilbert taking up his oars  we were playing elaine explained anne frigidly without even looking at her rescuer and i had to drift down to camelot in the barge i mean the flat the flat began to leak and i climbed out on the pile the girls went for help will you be kind enough to row me to the landing  gilbert obligingly rowed to the landing and anne disdaining assistance sprang nimbly on shore  im very much obliged to you she said haughtily as she turned away but gilbert had also sprung from the boat and now laid a detaining hand on her arm  anne he said hurriedly look here cant we be good friends im awfully sorry i made fun of your hair that time i didnt mean to vex you and i only meant it for a joke besides its so long ago i think your hair is awfully pretty now honest i do lets be friends  for a moment anne hesitated she had an odd newly awakened consciousness under all her outraged dignity that the half shy half eager expression in gilberts hazel eyes was something that was very good to see her heart gave a quick queer little beat but the bitterness of her old grievance promptly stiffened up her wavering determination that scene of two years before flashed back into her recollection as vividly as if it had taken place yesterday gilbert had called her carrots and had brought about her disgrace before the whole school her resentment which to other and older people might be as laughable as its cause was in no whit allayed and softened by time seemingly she hated gilbert blythe she would never forgive him  no she said coldly i shall never be friends with you gilbert blythe and i dont want to be  all right gilbert sprang into his skiff with an angry color in his cheeks ill never ask you to be friends again anne shirley and i dont care either  he pulled away with swift defiant strokes and anne went up the steep ferny little path under the maples she held her head very high but she was conscious of an odd feeling of regret she almost wished she had answered gilbert differently of course he had insulted her terribly but still  altogether anne rather thought it would be a relief to sit down and have a good cry she was really quite unstrung for the reaction from her fright and cramped clinging was making itself felt  halfway up the path she met jane and diana rushing back to the pond in a state narrowly removed from positive frenzy they had found nobody at orchard slope both mr and mrs barry being away here ruby gillis had succumbed to hysterics and was left to recover from them as best she might while jane and diana flew through the haunted wood and across the brook to green gables there they had found nobody either for marilla had gone to carmody and matthew was making hay in the back field  oh anne gasped diana fairly falling on the formers neck and weeping with relief and delight oh anne we thought you were drowned and we felt like murderers because we had made you be elaine and ruby is in hysterics oh anne how did you escape  i climbed up on one of the piles explained anne wearily and gilbert blythe came along in mr andrewss dory and brought me to land  oh anne how splendid of him why its so romantic said jane finding breath enough for utterance at last of course youll speak to him after this  of course i wont flashed anne with a momentary return of her old spirit and i dont want ever to hear the word ‘romantic again jane andrews im awfully sorry you were so frightened girls it is all my fault i feel sure i was born under an unlucky star everything i do gets me or my dearest friends into a scrape weve gone and lost your fathers flat diana and i have a presentiment that well not be allowed to row on the pond any more  annes presentiment proved more trustworthy than presentiments are apt to do great was the consternation in the barry and cuthbert households when the events of the afternoon became known  will you ever have any sense anne groaned marilla  oh yes i think i will marilla returned anne optimistically a good cry indulged in the grateful solitude of the east gable had soothed her nerves and restored her to her wonted cheerfulness i think my prospects of becoming sensible are brighter now than ever  i dont see how said marilla  well explained anne ive learned a new and valuable lesson today ever since i came to green gables ive been making mistakes and each mistake has helped to cure me of some great shortcoming the affair of the amethyst brooch cured me of meddling with things that didnt belong to me the haunted wood mistake cured me of letting my imagination run away with me the liniment cake mistake cured me of carelessness in cooking dyeing my hair cured me of vanity i never think about my hair and nose now at least very seldom and todays mistake is going to cure me of being too romantic i have come to the conclusion that it is no use trying to be romantic in avonlea it was probably easy enough in towered camelot hundreds of years ago but romance is not appreciated now i feel quite sure that you will soon see a great improvement in me in this respect marilla  im sure i hope so said marilla skeptically  but matthew who had been sitting mutely in his corner laid a hand on annes shoulder when marilla had gone out  dont give up all your romance anne he whispered shyly a little of it is a good thing not too much of course but keep a little of it anne keep a little of it     chapter xxix an epoch in annes life   anne was bringing the cows home from the back pasture by way of lovers lane it was a september evening and all the gaps and clearings in the woods were brimmed up with ruby sunset light here and there the lane was splashed with it but for the most part it was already quite shadowy beneath the maples and the spaces under the firs were filled with a clear violet dusk like airy wine the winds were out in their tops and there is no sweeter music on earth than that which the wind makes in the fir trees at evening  the cows swung placidly down the lane and anne followed them dreamily repeating aloud the battle canto from marmion which had also been part of their english course the preceding winter and which miss stacy had made them learn off by heart and exulting in its rushing lines and the clash of spears in its imagery when she came to the lines         the stubborn spearsmen still made good        their dark impenetrable wood  she stopped in ecstasy to shut her eyes that she might the better fancy herself one of that heroic ring when she opened them again it was to behold diana coming through the gate that led into the barry field and looking so important that anne instantly divined there was news to be told but betray too eager curiosity she would not  isnt this evening just like a purple dream diana it makes me so glad to be alive in the mornings i always think the mornings are best but when evening comes i think its lovelier still  its a very fine evening said diana but oh i have such news anne guess you can have three guesses  charlotte gillis is going to be married in the church after all and mrs allan wants us to decorate it cried anne  no charlottes beau wont agree to that because nobody ever has been married in the church yet and he thinks it would seem too much like a funeral its too mean because it would be such fun guess again  janes mother is going to let her have a birthday party  diana shook her head her black eyes dancing with merriment  i cant think what it can be said anne in despair unless its that moody spurgeon macpherson saw you home from prayer meeting last night did he  i should think not exclaimed diana indignantly i wouldnt be likely to boast of it if he did the horrid creature i knew you couldnt guess it mother had a letter from aunt josephine today and aunt josephine wants you and me to go to town next tuesday and stop with her for the exhibition there  oh diana whispered anne finding it necessary to lean up against a maple tree for support do you really mean it but im afraid marilla wont let me go she will say that she cant encourage gadding about that was what she said last week when jane invited me to go with them in their double seated buggy to the american concert at the white sands hotel i wanted to go but marilla said id be better at home learning my lessons and so would jane i was bitterly disappointed diana i felt so heartbroken that i wouldnt say my prayers when i went to bed but i repented of that and got up in the middle of the night and said them  ill tell you said diana well get mother to ask marilla shell be more likely to let you go then and if she does well have the time of our lives anne ive never been to an exhibition and its so aggravating to hear the other girls talking about their trips jane and ruby have been twice and theyre going this year again  im not going to think about it at all until i know whether i can go or not said anne resolutely if i did and then was disappointed it would be more than i could bear but in case i do go im very glad my new coat will be ready by that time marilla didnt think i needed a new coat she said my old one would do very well for another winter and that i ought to be satisfied with having a new dress the dress is very pretty diana navy blue and made so fashionably marilla always makes my dresses fashionably now because she says she doesnt intend to have matthew going to mrs lynde to make them im so glad it is ever so much easier to be good if your clothes are fashionable at least it is easier for me i suppose it doesnt make such a difference to naturally good people but matthew said i must have a new coat so marilla bought a lovely piece of blue broadcloth and its being made by a real dressmaker over at carmody its to be done saturday night and im trying not to imagine myself walking up the church aisle on sunday in my new suit and cap because im afraid it isnt right to imagine such things but it just slips into my mind in spite of me my cap is so pretty matthew bought it for me the day we were over at carmody it is one of those little blue velvet ones that are all the rage with gold cord and tassels your new hat is elegant diana and so becoming when i saw you come into church last sunday my heart swelled with pride to think you were my dearest friend do you suppose its wrong for us to think so much about our clothes marilla says it is very sinful but it is such an interesting subject isnt it  marilla agreed to let anne go to town and it was arranged that mr barry should take the girls in on the following tuesday as charlottetown was thirty miles away and mr barry wished to go and return the same day it was necessary to make a very early start but anne counted it all joy and was up before sunrise on tuesday morning a glance from her window assured her that the day would be fine for the eastern sky behind the firs of the haunted wood was all silvery and cloudless through the gap in the trees a light was shining in the western gable of orchard slope a token that diana was also up  anne was dressed by the time matthew had the fire on and had the breakfast ready when marilla came down but for her own part was much too excited to eat after breakfast the jaunty new cap and jacket were donned and anne hastened over the brook and up through the firs to orchard slope mr barry and diana were waiting for her and they were soon on the road  it was a long drive but anne and diana enjoyed every minute of it it was delightful to rattle along over the moist roads in the early red sunlight that was creeping across the shorn harvest fields the air was fresh and crisp and little smoke blue mists curled through the valleys and floated off from the hills sometimes the road went through woods where maples were beginning to hang out scarlet banners sometimes it crossed rivers on bridges that made annes flesh cringe with the old half delightful fear sometimes it wound along a harbor shore and passed by a little cluster of weather gray fishing huts again it mounted to hills whence a far sweep of curving upland or misty blue sky could be seen but wherever it went there was much of interest to discuss it was almost noon when they reached town and found their way to beechwood  it was quite a fine old mansion set back from the street in a seclusion of green elms and branching beeches miss barry met them at the door with a twinkle in her sharp black eyes  so youve come to see me at last you anne girl she said mercy child how you have grown youre taller than i am i declare and youre ever so much better looking than you used to be too but i dare say you know that without being told  indeed i didnt said anne radiantly i know im not so freckled as i used to be so ive much to be thankful for but i really hadnt dared to hope there was any other improvement im so glad you think there is miss barry miss barrys house was furnished with great magnificence  as anne told marilla afterward the two little country girls were rather abashed by the splendor of the parlor where miss barry left them when she went to see about dinner  isnt it just like a palace whispered diana i never was in aunt josephines house before and id no idea it was so grand i just wish julia bell could see this she puts on such airs about her mothers parlor  velvet carpet sighed anne luxuriously and silk curtains ive dreamed of such things diana but do you know i dont believe i feel very comfortable with them after all there are so many things in this room and all so splendid that there is no scope for imagination that is one consolation when you are poor there are so many more things you can imagine about  their sojourn in town was something that anne and diana dated from for years from first to last it was crowded with delights  on wednesday miss barry took them to the exhibition grounds and kept them there all day  it was splendid anne related to marilla later on i never imagined anything so interesting i dont really know which department was the most interesting i think i liked the horses and the flowers and the fancywork best josie pye took first prize for knitted lace i was real glad she did and i was glad that i felt glad for it shows im improving dont you think marilla when i can rejoice in josies success mr harmon andrews took second prize for gravenstein apples and mr bell took first prize for a pig diana said she thought it was ridiculous for a sunday school superintendent to take a prize in pigs but i dont see why do you she said she would always think of it after this when he was praying so solemnly clara louise macpherson took a prize for painting and mrs lynde got first prize for homemade butter and cheese so avonlea was pretty well represented wasnt it mrs lynde was there that day and i never knew how much i really liked her until i saw her familiar face among all those strangers there were thousands of people there marilla it made me feel dreadfully insignificant and miss barry took us up to the grandstand to see the horse races mrs lynde wouldnt go she said horse racing was an abomination and she being a church member thought it her bounden duty to set a good example by staying away but there were so many there i dont believe mrs lyndes absence would ever be noticed i dont think though that i ought to go very often to horse races because they are awfully fascinating diana got so excited that she offered to bet me ten cents that the red horse would win i didnt believe he would but i refused to bet because i wanted to tell mrs allan all about everything and i felt sure it wouldnt do to tell her that its always wrong to do anything you cant tell the ministers wife its as good as an extra conscience to have a ministers wife for your friend and i was very glad i didnt bet because the red horse did win and i would have lost ten cents so you see that virtue was its own reward we saw a man go up in a balloon id love to go up in a balloon marilla it would be simply thrilling and we saw a man selling fortunes you paid him ten cents and a little bird picked out your fortune for you miss barry gave diana and me ten cents each to have our fortunes told mine was that i would marry a dark complected man who was very wealthy and i would go across water to live i looked carefully at all the dark men i saw after that but i didnt care much for any of them and anyhow i suppose its too early to be looking out for him yet oh it was a never to be forgotten day marilla i was so tired i couldnt sleep at night miss barry put us in the spare room according to promise it was an elegant room marilla but somehow sleeping in a spare room isnt what i used to think it was thats the worst of growing up and im beginning to realize it the things you wanted so much when you were a child dont seem half so wonderful to you when you get them  thursday the girls had a drive in the park and in the evening miss barry took them to a concert in the academy of music where a noted prima donna was to sing to anne the evening was a glittering vision of delight  oh marilla it was beyond description i was so excited i couldnt even talk so you may know what it was like i just sat in enraptured silence madame selitsky was perfectly beautiful and wore white satin and diamonds but when she began to sing i never thought about anything else oh i cant tell you how i felt but it seemed to me that it could never be hard to be good any more i felt like i do when i look up to the stars tears came into my eyes but oh they were such happy tears i was so sorry when it was all over and i told miss barry i didnt see how i was ever to return to common life again she said she thought if we went over to the restaurant across the street and had an ice cream it might help me that sounded so prosaic but to my surprise i found it true the ice cream was delicious marilla and it was so lovely and dissipated to be sitting there eating it at eleven oclock at night diana said she believed she was born for city life miss barry asked me what my opinion was but i said i would have to think it over very seriously before i could tell her what i really thought so i thought it over after i went to bed that is the best time to think things out and i came to the conclusion marilla that i wasnt born for city life and that i was glad of it its nice to be eating ice cream at brilliant restaurants at eleven oclock at night once in a while but as a regular thing id rather be in the east gable at eleven sound asleep but kind of knowing even in my sleep that the stars were shining outside and that the wind was blowing in the firs across the brook i told miss barry so at breakfast the next morning and she laughed miss barry generally laughed at anything i said even when i said the most solemn things i dont think i liked it marilla because i wasnt trying to be funny but she is a most hospitable lady and treated us royally  friday brought going home time and mr barry drove in for the girls  well i hope youve enjoyed yourselves said miss barry as she bade them good bye  indeed we have said diana  and you anne girl  ive enjoyed every minute of the time said anne throwing her arms impulsively about the old womans neck and kissing her wrinkled cheek diana would never have dared to do such a thing and felt rather aghast at annes freedom but miss barry was pleased and she stood on her veranda and watched the buggy out of sight then she went back into her big house with a sigh it seemed very lonely lacking those fresh young lives miss barry was a rather selfish old lady if the truth must be told and had never cared much for anybody but herself she valued people only as they were of service to her or amused her anne had amused her and consequently stood high in the old ladys good graces but miss barry found herself thinking less about annes quaint speeches than of her fresh enthusiasms her transparent emotions her little winning ways and the sweetness of her eyes and lips  i thought marilla cuthbert was an old fool when i heard shed adopted a girl out of an orphan asylum she said to herself but i guess she didnt make much of a mistake after all if id a child like anne in the house all the time id be a better and happier woman  anne and diana found the drive home as pleasant as the drive in pleasanter indeed since there was the delightful consciousness of home waiting at the end of it it was sunset when they passed through white sands and turned into the shore road beyond the avonlea hills came out darkly against the saffron sky behind them the moon was rising out of the sea that grew all radiant and transfigured in her light every little cove along the curving road was a marvel of dancing ripples the waves broke with a soft swish on the rocks below them and the tang of the sea was in the strong fresh air  oh but its good to be alive and to be going home breathed anne  when she crossed the log bridge over the brook the kitchen light of green gables winked her a friendly welcome back and through the open door shone the hearth fire sending out its warm red glow athwart the chilly autumn night anne ran blithely up the hill and into the kitchen where a hot supper was waiting on the table  so youve got back said marilla folding up her knitting  yes and oh its so good to be back said anne joyously i could kiss everything even to the clock marilla a broiled chicken you dont mean to say you cooked that for me  yes i did said marilla i thought youd be hungry after such a drive and need something real appetizing hurry and take off your things and well have supper as soon as matthew comes in im glad youve got back i must say its been fearful lonesome here without you and i never put in four longer days  after supper anne sat before the fire between matthew and marilla and gave them a full account of her visit  ive had a splendid time she concluded happily and i feel that it marks an epoch in my life but the best of it all was the coming home     chapter xxx the queens class is organized   marilla laid her knitting on her lap and leaned back in her chair her eyes were tired and she thought vaguely that she must see about having her glasses changed the next time she went to town for her eyes had grown tired very often of late  it was nearly dark for the full november twilight had fallen around green gables and the only light in the kitchen came from the dancing red flames in the stove  anne was curled up turk fashion on the hearthrug gazing into that joyous glow where the sunshine of a hundred summers was being distilled from the maple cordwood she had been reading but her book had slipped to the floor and now she was dreaming with a smile on her parted lips glittering castles in spain were shaping themselves out of the mists and rainbows of her lively fancy adventures wonderful and enthralling were happening to her in cloudland adventures that always turned out triumphantly and never involved her in scrapes like those of actual life  marilla looked at her with a tenderness that would never have been suffered to reveal itself in any clearer light than that soft mingling of fireshine and shadow the lesson of a love that should display itself easily in spoken word and open look was one marilla could never learn but she had learned to love this slim gray eyed girl with an affection all the deeper and stronger from its very undemonstrativeness her love made her afraid of being unduly indulgent indeed she had an uneasy feeling that it was rather sinful to set ones heart so intensely on any human creature as she had set hers on anne and perhaps she performed a sort of unconscious penance for this by being stricter and more critical than if the girl had been less dear to her certainly anne herself had no idea how marilla loved her she sometimes thought wistfully that marilla was very hard to please and distinctly lacking in sympathy and understanding but she always checked the thought reproachfully remembering what she owed to marilla  anne said marilla abruptly miss stacy was here this afternoon when you were out with diana  anne came back from her other world with a start and a sigh  was she oh im so sorry i wasnt in why didnt you call me marilla diana and i were only over in the haunted wood its lovely in the woods now all the little wood things the ferns and the satin leaves and the crackerberries have gone to sleep just as if somebody had tucked them away until spring under a blanket of leaves i think it was a little gray fairy with a rainbow scarf that came tiptoeing along the last moonlight night and did it diana wouldnt say much about that though diana has never forgotten the scolding her mother gave her about imagining ghosts into the haunted wood it had a very bad effect on dianas imagination it blighted it mrs lynde says myrtle bell is a blighted being i asked ruby gillis why myrtle was blighted and ruby said she guessed it was because her young man had gone back on her ruby gillis thinks of nothing but young men and the older she gets the worse she is young men are all very well in their place but it doesnt do to drag them into everything does it diana and i are thinking seriously of promising each other that we will never marry but be nice old maids and live together forever diana hasnt quite made up her mind though because she thinks perhaps it would be nobler to marry some wild dashing wicked young man and reform him diana and i talk a great deal about serious subjects now you know we feel that we are so much older than we used to be that it isnt becoming to talk of childish matters its such a solemn thing to be almost fourteen marilla miss stacy took all us girls who are in our teens down to the brook last wednesday and talked to us about it she said we couldnt be too careful what habits we formed and what ideals we acquired in our teens because by the time we were twenty our characters would be developed and the foundation laid for our whole future life and she said if the foundation was shaky we could never build anything really worth while on it diana and i talked the matter over coming home from school we felt extremely solemn marilla and we decided that we would try to be very careful indeed and form respectable habits and learn all we could and be as sensible as possible so that by the time we were twenty our characters would be properly developed its perfectly appalling to think of being twenty marilla it sounds so fearfully old and grown up but why was miss stacy here this afternoon  that is what i want to tell you anne if youll ever give me a chance to get a word in edgewise she was talking about you  about me anne looked rather scared then she flushed and exclaimed   oh i know what she was saying i meant to tell you marilla honestly i did but i forgot miss stacy caught me reading ben hur in school yesterday afternoon when i should have been studying my canadian history jane andrews lent it to me i was reading it at dinner hour and i had just got to the chariot race when school went in i was simply wild to know how it turned out although i felt sure ben hur must win because it wouldnt be poetical justice if he didnt so i spread the history open on my desk lid and then tucked ben hur between the desk and my knee i just looked as if i were studying canadian history you know while all the while i was reveling in ben hur i was so interested in it that i never noticed miss stacy coming down the aisle until all at once i just looked up and there she was looking down at me so reproachful like i cant tell you how ashamed i felt marilla especially when i heard josie pye giggling miss stacy took ben hur away but she never said a word then she kept me in at recess and talked to me she said i had done very wrong in two respects first i was wasting the time i ought to have put on my studies and secondly i was deceiving my teacher in trying to make it appear i was reading a history when it was a storybook instead i had never realized until that moment marilla that what i was doing was deceitful i was shocked i cried bitterly and asked miss stacy to forgive me and id never do such a thing again and i offered to do penance by never so much as looking at ben hur for a whole week not even to see how the chariot race turned out but miss stacy said she wouldnt require that and she forgave me freely so i think it wasnt very kind of her to come up here to you about it after all  miss stacy never mentioned such a thing to me anne and its only your guilty conscience thats the matter with you you have no business to be taking storybooks to school you read too many novels anyhow when i was a girl i wasnt so much as allowed to look at a novel  oh how can you call ben hur a novel when its really such a religious book protested anne of course its a little too exciting to be proper reading for sunday and i only read it on weekdays and i never read any book now unless either miss stacy or mrs allan thinks it is a proper book for a girl thirteen and three quarters to read miss stacy made me promise that she found me reading a book one day called the lurid mystery of the haunted hall it was one ruby gillis had lent me and oh marilla it was so fascinating and creepy it just curdled the blood in my veins but miss stacy said it was a very silly unwholesome book and she asked me not to read any more of it or any like it i didnt mind promising not to read any more like it but it was agonizing to give back that book without knowing how it turned out but my love for miss stacy stood the test and i did its really wonderful marilla what you can do when youre truly anxious to please a certain person  well i guess ill light the lamp and get to work said marilla i see plainly that you dont want to hear what miss stacy had to say youre more interested in the sound of your own tongue than in anything else  oh indeed marilla i do want to hear it cried anne contritely i wont say another word not one i know i talk too much but i am really trying to overcome it and although i say far too much yet if you only knew how many things i want to say and dont youd give me some credit for it please tell me marilla  well miss stacy wants to organize a class among her advanced students who mean to study for the entrance examination into queens she intends to give them extra lessons for an hour after school and she came to ask matthew and me if we would like to have you join it what do you think about it yourself anne would you like to go to queens and pass for a teacher  oh marilla anne straightened to her knees and clasped her hands its been the dream of my life that is for the last six months ever since ruby and jane began to talk of studying for the entrance but i didnt say anything about it because i supposed it would be perfectly useless id love to be a teacher but wont it be dreadfully expensive mr andrews says it cost him one hundred and fifty dollars to put prissy through and prissy wasnt a dunce in geometry  i guess you neednt worry about that part of it when matthew and i took you to bring up we resolved we would do the best we could for you and give you a good education i believe in a girl being fitted to earn her own living whether she ever has to or not youll always have a home at green gables as long as matthew and i are here but nobody knows what is going to happen in this uncertain world and its just as well to be prepared so you can join the queens class if you like anne  oh marilla thank you anne flung her arms about marillas waist and looked up earnestly into her face im extremely grateful to you and matthew and ill study as hard as i can and do my very best to be a credit to you i warn you not to expect much in geometry but i think i can hold my own in anything else if i work hard  i dare say youll get along well enough miss stacy says you are bright and diligent not for worlds would marilla have told anne just what miss stacy had said about her that would have been to pamper vanity you neednt rush to any extreme of killing yourself over your books there is no hurry you wont be ready to try the entrance for a year and a half yet but its well to begin in time and be thoroughly grounded miss stacy says  i shall take more interest than ever in my studies now said anne blissfully because i have a purpose in life mr allan says everybody should have a purpose in life and pursue it faithfully only he says we must first make sure that it is a worthy purpose i would call it a worthy purpose to want to be a teacher like miss stacy wouldnt you marilla i think its a very noble profession  the queens class was organized in due time gilbert blythe anne shirley ruby gillis jane andrews josie pye charlie sloane and moody spurgeon macpherson joined it diana barry did not as her parents did not intend to send her to queens this seemed nothing short of a calamity to anne never since the night on which minnie may had had the croup had she and diana been separated in anything on the evening when the queens class first remained in school for the extra lessons and anne saw diana go slowly out with the others to walk home alone through the birch path and violet vale it was all the former could do to keep her seat and refrain from rushing impulsively after her chum a lump came into her throat and she hastily retired behind the pages of her uplifted latin grammar to hide the tears in her eyes not for worlds would anne have had gilbert blythe or josie pye see those tears  but oh marilla i really felt that i had tasted the bitterness of death as mr allan said in his sermon last sunday when i saw diana go out alone she said mournfully that night i thought how splendid it would have been if diana had only been going to study for the entrance too but we cant have things perfect in this imperfect world as mrs lynde says mrs lynde isnt exactly a comforting person sometimes but theres no doubt she says a great many very true things and i think the queens class is going to be extremely interesting jane and ruby are just going to study to be teachers that is the height of their ambition ruby says she will only teach for two years after she gets through and then she intends to be married jane says she will devote her whole life to teaching and never never marry because you are paid a salary for teaching but a husband wont pay you anything and growls if you ask for a share in the egg and butter money i expect jane speaks from mournful experience for mrs lynde says that her father is a perfect old crank and meaner than second skimmings josie pye says she is just going to college for educations sake because she wont have to earn her own living she says of course it is different with orphans who are living on charity they have to hustle moody spurgeon is going to be a minister mrs lynde says he couldnt be anything else with a name like that to live up to i hope it isnt wicked of me marilla but really the thought of moody spurgeon being a minister makes me laugh hes such a funny looking boy with that big fat face and his little blue eyes and his ears sticking out like flaps but perhaps he will be more intellectual looking when he grows up charlie sloane says hes going to go into politics and be a member of parliament but mrs lynde says hell never succeed at that because the sloanes are all honest people and its only rascals that get on in politics nowadays  what is gilbert blythe going to be queried marilla seeing that anne was opening her cæsar  i dont happen to know what gilbert blythes ambition in life is if he has any said anne scornfully  there was open rivalry between gilbert and anne now previously the rivalry had been rather one sided but there was no longer any doubt that gilbert was as determined to be first in class as anne was he was a foeman worthy of her steel the other members of the class tacitly acknowledged their superiority and never dreamed of trying to compete with them  since the day by the pond when she had refused to listen to his plea for forgiveness gilbert save for the aforesaid determined rivalry had evinced no recognition whatever of the existence of anne shirley he talked and jested with the other girls exchanged books and puzzles with them discussed lessons and plans sometimes walked home with one or the other of them from prayer meeting or debating club but anne shirley he simply ignored and anne found out that it is not pleasant to be ignored it was in vain that she told herself with a toss of her head that she did not care deep down in her wayward feminine little heart she knew that she did care and that if she had that chance of the lake of shining waters again she would answer very differently all at once as it seemed and to her secret dismay she found that the old resentment she had cherished against him was gone gone just when she most needed its sustaining power it was in vain that she recalled every incident and emotion of that memorable occasion and tried to feel the old satisfying anger that day by the pond had witnessed its last spasmodic flicker anne realized that she had forgiven and forgotten without knowing it but it was too late  and at least neither gilbert nor anybody else not even diana should ever suspect how sorry she was and how much she wished she hadnt been so proud and horrid she determined to shroud her feelings in deepest oblivion and it may be stated here and now that she did it so successfully that gilbert who possibly was not quite so indifferent as he seemed could not console himself with any belief that anne felt his retaliatory scorn the only poor comfort he had was that she snubbed charlie sloane unmercifully continually and undeservedly  otherwise the winter passed away in a round of pleasant duties and studies for anne the days slipped by like golden beads on the necklace of the year she was happy eager interested there were lessons to be learned and honor to be won delightful books to read new pieces to be practiced for the sunday school choir pleasant saturday afternoons at the manse with mrs allan and then almost before anne realized it spring had come again to green gables and all the world was abloom once more  studies palled just a wee bit then the queens class left behind in school while the others scattered to green lanes and leafy wood cuts and meadow byways looked wistfully out of the windows and discovered that latin verbs and french exercises had somehow lost the tang and zest they had possessed in the crisp winter months even anne and gilbert lagged and grew indifferent teacher and taught were alike glad when the term was ended and the glad vacation days stretched rosily before them  but youve done good work this past year miss stacy told them on the last evening and you deserve a good jolly vacation have the best time you can in the out of door world and lay in a good stock of health and vitality and ambition to carry you through next year it will be the tug of war you know the last year before the entrance  are you going to be back next year miss stacy asked josie pye  josie pye never scrupled to ask questions in this instance the rest of the class felt grateful to her none of them would have dared to ask it of miss stacy but all wanted to for there had been alarming rumors running at large through the school for some time that miss stacy was not coming back the next year that she had been offered a position in the grade school of her own home district and meant to accept the queens class listened in breathless suspense for her answer  yes i think i will said miss stacy i thought of taking another school but i have decided to come back to avonlea to tell the truth ive grown so interested in my pupils here that i found i couldnt leave them so ill stay and see you through  hurrah said moody spurgeon moody spurgeon had never been so carried away by his feelings before and he blushed uncomfortably every time he thought about it for a week  oh im so glad said anne with shining eyes dear stacy it would be perfectly dreadful if you didnt come back i dont believe i could have the heart to go on with my studies at all if another teacher came here  when anne got home that night she stacked all her textbooks away in an old trunk in the attic locked it and threw the key into the blanket box  im not even going to look at a schoolbook in vacation she told marilla ive studied as hard all the term as i possibly could and ive pored over that geometry until i know every proposition in the first book off by heart even when the letters are changed i just feel tired of everything sensible and im going to let my imagination run riot for the summer oh you neednt be alarmed marilla ill only let it run riot within reasonable limits but i want to have a real good jolly time this summer for maybe its the last summer ill be a little girl mrs lynde says that if i keep stretching out next year as ive done this ill have to put on longer skirts she says im all running to legs and eyes and when i put on longer skirts i shall feel that i have to live up to them and be very dignified it wont even do to believe in fairies then im afraid so im going to believe in them with all my whole heart this summer i think were going to have a very gay vacation ruby gillis is going to have a birthday party soon and theres the sunday school picnic and the missionary concert next month and mr barry says that some evening hell take diana and me over to the white sands hotel and have dinner there they have dinner there in the evening you know jane andrews was over once last summer and she says it was a dazzling sight to see the electric lights and the flowers and all the lady guests in such beautiful dresses jane says it was her first glimpse into high life and shell never forget it to her dying day  mrs lynde came up the next afternoon to find out why marilla had not been at the aid meeting on thursday when marilla was not at aid meeting people knew there was something wrong at green gables  matthew had a bad spell with his heart thursday marilla explained and i didnt feel like leaving him oh yes hes all right again now but he takes them spells oftener than he used to and im anxious about him the doctor says he must be careful to avoid excitement thats easy enough for matthew doesnt go about looking for excitement by any means and never did but hes not to do any very heavy work either and you might as well tell matthew not to breathe as not to work come and lay off your things rachel youll stay to tea  well seeing youre so pressing perhaps i might as well stay said mrs rachel who had not the slightest intention of doing anything else  mrs rachel and marilla sat comfortably in the parlor while anne got the tea and made hot biscuits that were light and white enough to defy even mrs rachels criticism  i must say anne has turned out a real smart girl admitted mrs rachel as marilla accompanied her to the end of the lane at sunset she must be a great help to you  she is said marilla and shes real steady and reliable now i used to be afraid shed never get over her featherbrained ways but she has and i wouldnt be afraid to trust her in anything now  i never would have thought shed have turned out so well that first day i was here three years ago said mrs rachel lawful heart shall i ever forget that tantrum of hers when i went home that night i says to thomas says i ‘mark my words thomas marilla cuthbert ‘ll live to rue the step shes took but i was mistaken and im real glad of it i aint one of those kind of people marilla as can never be brought to own up that theyve made a mistake no that never was my way thank goodness i did make a mistake in judging anne but it werent no wonder for an odder unexpecteder witch of a child there never was in this world thats what there was no ciphering her out by the rules that worked with other children its nothing short of wonderful how shes improved these three years but especially in looks shes a real pretty girl got to be though i cant say im overly partial to that pale big eyed style myself i like more snap and color like diana barry has or ruby gillis ruby gilliss looks are real showy but somehow i dont know how it is but when anne and them are together though she aint half as handsome she makes them look kind of common and overdone something like them white june lilies she calls narcissus alongside of the big red peonies thats what     chapter xxxi where the brook and river meet   anne had her good summer and enjoyed it wholeheartedly she and diana fairly lived outdoors reveling in all the delights that lovers lane and the dryads bubble and willowmere and victoria island afforded marilla offered no objections to annes gypsyings the spencervale doctor who had come the night minnie may had the croup met anne at the house of a patient one afternoon early in vacation looked her over sharply screwed up his mouth shook his head and sent a message to marilla cuthbert by another person it was   keep that redheaded girl of yours in the open air all summer and dont let her read books until she gets more spring into her step  this message frightened marilla wholesomely she read annes death warrant by consumption in it unless it was scrupulously obeyed as a result anne had the golden summer of her life as far as freedom and frolic went she walked rowed berried and dreamed to her hearts content and when september came she was bright eyed and alert with a step that would have satisfied the spencervale doctor and a heart full of ambition and zest once more  i feel just like studying with might and main she declared as she brought her books down from the attic oh you good old friends im glad to see your honest faces once more yes even you geometry ive had a perfectly beautiful summer marilla and now im rejoicing as a strong man to run a race as mr allan said last sunday doesnt mr allan preach magnificent sermons mrs lynde says he is improving every day and the first thing we know some city church will gobble him up and then well be left and have to turn to and break in another green preacher but i dont see the use of meeting trouble halfway do you marilla i think it would be better just to enjoy mr allan while we have him if i were a man i think id be a minister they can have such an influence for good if their theology is sound and it must be thrilling to preach splendid sermons and stir your hearers hearts why cant women be ministers marilla i asked mrs lynde that and she was shocked and said it would be a scandalous thing she said there might be female ministers in the states and she believed there was but thank goodness we hadnt got to that stage in canada yet and she hoped we never would but i dont see why i think women would make splendid ministers when there is a social to be got up or a church tea or anything else to raise money the women have to turn to and do the work im sure mrs lynde can pray every bit as well as superintendent bell and ive no doubt she could preach too with a little practice  yes i believe she could said marilla dryly she does plenty of unofficial preaching as it is nobody has much of a chance to go wrong in avonlea with rachel to oversee them  marilla said anne in a burst of confidence i want to tell you something and ask you what you think about it it has worried me terribly on sunday afternoons that is when i think specially about such matters i do really want to be good and when im with you or mrs allan or miss stacy i want it more than ever and i want to do just what would please you and what you would approve of but mostly when im with mrs lynde i feel desperately wicked and as if i wanted to go and do the very thing she tells me i oughtnt to do i feel irresistibly tempted to do it now what do you think is the reason i feel like that do you think its because im really bad and unregenerate  marilla looked dubious for a moment then she laughed  if you are i guess i am too anne for rachel often has that very effect on me i sometimes think shed have more of an influence for good as you say yourself if she didnt keep nagging people to do right there should have been a special commandment against nagging but there i shouldnt talk so rachel is a good christian woman and she means well there isnt a kinder soul in avonlea and she never shirks her share of work  im very glad you feel the same said anne decidedly its so encouraging i shant worry so much over that after this but i dare say therell be other things to worry me they keep coming up new all the time things to perplex you you know you settle one question and theres another right after there are so many things to be thought over and decided when youre beginning to grow up it keeps me busy all the time thinking them over and deciding what is right its a serious thing to grow up isnt it marilla but when i have such good friends as you and matthew and mrs allan and miss stacy i ought to grow up successfully and im sure it will be my own fault if i dont i feel its a great responsibility because i have only the one chance if i dont grow up right i cant go back and begin over again ive grown two inches this summer marilla mr gillis measured me at rubys party im so glad you made my new dresses longer that dark green one is so pretty and it was sweet of you to put on the flounce of course i know it wasnt really necessary but flounces are so stylish this fall and josie pye has flounces on all her dresses i know ill be able to study better because of mine i shall have such a comfortable feeling deep down in my mind about that flounce  its worth something to have that admitted marilla  miss stacy came back to avonlea school and found all her pupils eager for work once more especially did the queens class gird up their loins for the fray for at the end of the coming year dimly shadowing their pathway already loomed up that fateful thing known as the entrance  at the thought of which one and all felt their hearts sink into their very shoes suppose they did not pass that thought was doomed to haunt anne through the waking hours of that winter sunday afternoons inclusive to the almost entire exclusion of moral and theological problems when anne had bad dreams she found herself staring miserably at pass lists of the entrance exams where gilbert blythes name was blazoned at the top and in which hers did not appear at all  but it was a jolly busy happy swift flying winter schoolwork was as interesting class rivalry as absorbing as of yore new worlds of thought feeling and ambition fresh fascinating fields of unexplored knowledge seemed to be opening out before annes eager eyes        hills peeped oer hill and alps on alps arose  much of all this was due to miss stacys tactful careful broadminded guidance she led her class to think and explore and discover for themselves and encouraged straying from the old beaten paths to a degree that quite shocked mrs lynde and the school trustees who viewed all innovations on established methods rather dubiously  apart from her studies anne expanded socially for marilla mindful of the spencervale doctors dictum no longer vetoed occasional outings the debating club flourished and gave several concerts there were one or two parties almost verging on grown up affairs there were sleigh drives and skating frolics galore  between times anne grew shooting up so rapidly that marilla was astonished one day when they were standing side by side to find the girl was taller than herself  why anne how youve grown she said almost unbelievingly a sigh followed on the words marilla felt a queer regret over annes inches the child she had learned to love had vanished somehow and here was this tall serious eyed girl of fifteen with the thoughtful brows and the proudly poised little head in her place marilla loved the girl as much as she had loved the child but she was conscious of a queer sorrowful sense of loss and that night when anne had gone to prayer meeting with diana marilla sat alone in the wintry twilight and indulged in the weakness of a cry matthew coming in with a lantern caught her at it and gazed at her in such consternation that marilla had to laugh through her tears  i was thinking about anne she explained shes got to be such a big girl and shell probably be away from us next winter ill miss her terrible  shell be able to come home often comforted matthew to whom anne was as yet and always would be the little eager girl he had brought home from bright river on that june evening four years before the branch railroad will be built to carmody by that time  it wont be the same thing as having her here all the time sighed marilla gloomily determined to enjoy her luxury of grief uncomforted but there men cant understand these things  there were other changes in anne no less real than the physical change for one thing she became much quieter perhaps she thought all the more and dreamed as much as ever but she certainly talked less marilla noticed and commented on this also  you dont chatter half as much as you used to anne nor use half as many big words what has come over you  anne colored and laughed a little as she dropped her book and looked dreamily out of the window where big fat red buds were bursting out on the creeper in response to the lure of the spring sunshine  i dont know i dont want to talk as much she said denting her chin thoughtfully with her forefinger its nicer to think dear pretty thoughts and keep them in ones heart like treasures i dont like to have them laughed at or wondered over and somehow i dont want to use big words any more its almost a pity isnt it now that im really growing big enough to say them if i did want to its fun to be almost grown up in some ways but its not the kind of fun i expected marilla theres so much to learn and do and think that there isnt time for big words besides miss stacy says the short ones are much stronger and better she makes us write all our essays as simply as possible it was hard at first i was so used to crowding in all the fine big words i could think of and i thought of any number of them but ive got used to it now and i see its so much better  what has become of your story club i havent heard you speak of it for a long time  the story club isnt in existence any longer we hadnt time for it and anyhow i think we had got tired of it it was silly to be writing about love and murder and elopements and mysteries miss stacy sometimes has us write a story for training in composition but she wont let us write anything but what might happen in avonlea in our own lives and she criticizes it very sharply and makes us criticize our own too i never thought my compositions had so many faults until i began to look for them myself i felt so ashamed i wanted to give up altogether but miss stacy said i could learn to write well if i only trained myself to be my own severest critic and so i am trying to  youve only two more months before the entrance said marilla do you think youll be able to get through  anne shivered  i dont know sometimes i think ill be all right and then i get horribly afraid weve studied hard and miss stacy has drilled us thoroughly but we maynt get through for all that weve each got a stumbling block mine is geometry of course and janes is latin and ruby and charlies is algebra and josies is arithmetic moody spurgeon says he feels it in his bones that he is going to fail in english history miss stacy is going to give us examinations in june just as hard as well have at the entrance and mark us just as strictly so well have some idea i wish it was all over marilla it haunts me sometimes i wake up in the night and wonder what ill do if i dont pass  why go to school next year and try again said marilla unconcernedly  oh i dont believe id have the heart for it it would be such a disgrace to fail especially if gil if the others passed and i get so nervous in an examination that im likely to make a mess of it i wish i had nerves like jane andrews nothing rattles her  anne sighed and dragging her eyes from the witcheries of the spring world the beckoning day of breeze and blue and the green things upspringing in the garden buried herself resolutely in her book there would be other springs but if she did not succeed in passing the entrance anne felt convinced that she would never recover sufficiently to enjoy them     chapter xxxii the pass list is out   with the end of june came the close of the term and the close of miss stacys rule in avonlea school anne and diana walked home that evening feeling very sober indeed red eyes and damp handkerchiefs bore convincing testimony to the fact that miss stacys farewell words must have been quite as touching as mr phillipss had been under similar circumstances three years before diana looked back at the schoolhouse from the foot of the spruce hill and sighed deeply  it does seem as if it was the end of everything doesnt it she said dismally  you oughtnt to feel half as badly as i do said anne hunting vainly for a dry spot on her handkerchief youll be back again next winter but i suppose ive left the dear old school forever if i have good luck that is  it wont be a bit the same miss stacy wont be there nor you nor jane nor ruby probably i shall have to sit all alone for i couldnt bear to have another deskmate after you oh we have had jolly times havent we anne its dreadful to think theyre all over  two big tears rolled down by dianas nose  if you would stop crying i could said anne imploringly just as soon as i put away my hanky i see you brimming up and that starts me off again as mrs lynde says ‘if you cant be cheerful be as cheerful as you can after all i dare say ill be back next year this is one of the times i know im not going to pass theyre getting alarmingly frequent  why you came out splendidly in the exams miss stacy gave  yes but those exams didnt make me nervous when i think of the real thing you cant imagine what a horrid cold fluttery feeling comes round my heart and then my number is thirteen and josie pye says its so unlucky i am not superstitious and i know it can make no difference but still i wish it wasnt thirteen  i do wish i was going in with you said diana wouldnt we have a perfectly elegant time but i suppose youll have to cram in the evenings  no miss stacy has made us promise not to open a book at all she says it would only tire and confuse us and we are to go out walking and not think about the exams at all and go to bed early its good advice but i expect it will be hard to follow good advice is apt to be i think prissy andrews told me that she sat up half the night every night of her entrance week and crammed for dear life and i had determined to sit up at least as long as she did it was so kind of your aunt josephine to ask me to stay at beechwood while im in town  youll write to me while youre in wont you  ill write tuesday night and tell you how the first day goes promised anne  ill be haunting the post office wednesday vowed diana  anne went to town the following monday and on wednesday diana haunted the post office as agreed and got her letter   dearest diana wrote anne  here it is tuesday night and im writing this in the library at beechwood last night i was horribly lonesome all alone in my room and wished so much you were with me i couldnt ‘cram because id promised miss stacy not to but it was as hard to keep from opening my history as it used to be to keep from reading a story before my lessons were learned  this morning miss stacy came for me and we went to the academy calling for jane and ruby and josie on our way ruby asked me to feel her hands and they were as cold as ice josie said i looked as if i hadnt slept a wink and she didnt believe i was strong enough to stand the grind of the teachers course even if i did get through there are times and seasons even yet when i dont feel that ive made any great headway in learning to like josie pye  when we reached the academy there were scores of students there from all over the island the first person we saw was moody spurgeon sitting on the steps and muttering away to himself jane asked him what on earth he was doing and he said he was repeating the multiplication table over and over to steady his nerves and for pitys sake not to interrupt him because if he stopped for a moment he got frightened and forgot everything he ever knew but the multiplication table kept all his facts firmly in their proper place  when we were assigned to our rooms miss stacy had to leave us jane and i sat together and jane was so composed that i envied her no need of the multiplication table for good steady sensible jane i wondered if i looked as i felt and if they could hear my heart thumping clear across the room then a man came in and began distributing the english examination sheets my hands grew cold then and my head fairly whirled around as i picked it up just one awful moment diana i felt exactly as i did four years ago when i asked marilla if i might stay at green gables and then everything cleared up in my mind and my heart began beating again i forgot to say that it had stopped altogether for i knew i could do something with that paper anyhow  at noon we went home for dinner and then back again for history in the afternoon the history was a pretty hard paper and i got dreadfully mixed up in the dates still i think i did fairly well today but oh diana tomorrow the geometry exam comes off and when i think of it it takes every bit of determination i possess to keep from opening my euclid if i thought the multiplication table would help me any i would recite it from now till tomorrow morning  i went down to see the other girls this evening on my way i met moody spurgeon wandering distractedly around he said he knew he had failed in history and he was born to be a disappointment to his parents and he was going home on the morning train and it would be easier to be a carpenter than a minister anyhow i cheered him up and persuaded him to stay to the end because it would be unfair to miss stacy if he didnt sometimes i have wished i was born a boy but when i see moody spurgeon im always glad im a girl and not his sister  ruby was in hysterics when i reached their boardinghouse she had just discovered a fearful mistake she had made in her english paper when she recovered we went uptown and had an ice cream how we wished you had been with us  oh diana if only the geometry examination were over but there as mrs lynde would say the sun will go on rising and setting whether i fail in geometry or not that is true but not especially comforting i think id rather it didnt go on if i failed  yours devotedly anne   the geometry examination and all the others were over in due time and anne arrived home on friday evening rather tired but with an air of chastened triumph about her diana was over at green gables when she arrived and they met as if they had been parted for years  you old darling its perfectly splendid to see you back again it seems like an age since you went to town and oh anne how did you get along  pretty well i think in everything but the geometry i dont know whether i passed in it or not and i have a creepy crawly presentiment that i didnt oh how good it is to be back green gables is the dearest loveliest spot in the world  how did the others do  the girls say they know they didnt pass but i think they did pretty well josie says the geometry was so easy a child of ten could do it moody spurgeon still thinks he failed in history and charlie says he failed in algebra but we dont really know anything about it and wont until the pass list is out that wont be for a fortnight fancy living a fortnight in such suspense i wish i could go to sleep and never wake up until it is over  diana knew it would be useless to ask how gilbert blythe had fared so she merely said   oh youll pass all right dont worry  id rather not pass at all than not come out pretty well up on the list flashed anne by which she meant and diana knew she meant that success would be incomplete and bitter if she did not come out ahead of gilbert blythe  with this end in view anne had strained every nerve during the examinations so had gilbert they had met and passed each other on the street a dozen times without any sign of recognition and every time anne had held her head a little higher and wished a little more earnestly that she had made friends with gilbert when he asked her and vowed a little more determinedly to surpass him in the examination she knew that all avonlea junior was wondering which would come out first she even knew that jimmy glover and ned wright had a bet on the question and that josie pye had said there was no doubt in the world that gilbert would be first and she felt that her humiliation would be unbearable if she failed  but she had another and nobler motive for wishing to do well she wanted to pass high for the sake of matthew and marilla especially matthew matthew had declared to her his conviction that she would beat the whole island that anne felt was something it would be foolish to hope for even in the wildest dreams but she did hope fervently that she would be among the first ten at least so that she might see matthews kindly brown eyes gleam with pride in her achievement that she felt would be a sweet reward indeed for all her hard work and patient grubbing among unimaginative equations and conjugations  at the end of the fortnight anne took to haunting the post office also in the distracted company of jane ruby and josie opening the charlottetown dailies with shaking hands and cold sinkaway feelings as bad as any experienced during the entrance week charlie and gilbert were not above doing this too but moody spurgeon stayed resolutely away  i havent got the grit to go there and look at a paper in cold blood  he told anne im just going to wait until somebody comes and tells me suddenly whether ive passed or not  when three weeks had gone by without the pass list appearing anne began to feel that she really couldnt stand the strain much longer her appetite failed and her interest in avonlea doings languished mrs lynde wanted to know what else you could expect with a tory superintendent of education at the head of affairs and matthew noting annes paleness and indifference and the lagging steps that bore her home from the post office every afternoon began seriously to wonder if he hadnt better vote grit at the next election  but one evening the news came anne was sitting at her open window for the time forgetful of the woes of examinations and the cares of the world as she drank in the beauty of the summer dusk sweet scented with flower breaths from the garden below and sibilant and rustling from the stir of poplars the eastern sky above the firs was flushed faintly pink from the reflection of the west and anne was wondering dreamily if the spirit of color looked like that when she saw diana come flying down through the firs over the log bridge and up the slope with a fluttering newspaper in her hand  anne sprang to her feet knowing at once what that paper contained the pass list was out her head whirled and her heart beat until it hurt her she could not move a step it seemed an hour to her before diana came rushing along the hall and burst into the room without even knocking so great was her excitement  anne youve passed she cried passed the very first you and gilbert both youre ties but your name is first oh im so proud  diana flung the paper on the table and herself on annes bed utterly breathless and incapable of further speech anne lighted the lamp oversetting the match safe and using up half a dozen matches before her shaking hands could accomplish the task then she snatched up the paper yes she had passed there was her name at the very top of a list of two hundred that moment was worth living for  you did just splendidly anne puffed diana recovering sufficiently to sit up and speak for anne starry eyed and rapt had not uttered a word father brought the paper home from bright river not ten minutes ago it came out on the afternoon train you know and wont be here till tomorrow by mail and when i saw the pass list i just rushed over like a wild thing youve all passed every one of you moody spurgeon and all although hes conditioned in history jane and ruby did pretty well theyre halfway up and so did charlie josie just scraped through with three marks to spare but youll see shell put on as many airs as if shed led wont miss stacy be delighted oh anne what does it feel like to see your name at the head of a pass list like that if it were me i know id go crazy with joy i am pretty near crazy as it is but youre as calm and cool as a spring evening  im just dazzled inside said anne i want to say a hundred things and i cant find words to say them in i never dreamed of this yes i did too just once i let myself think once ‘what if i should come out first quakingly you know for it seemed so vain and presumptuous to think i could lead the island excuse me a minute diana i must run right out to the field to tell matthew then well go up the road and tell the good news to the others  they hurried to the hayfield below the barn where matthew was coiling hay and as luck would have it mrs lynde was talking to marilla at the lane fence  oh matthew exclaimed anne ive passed and im first or one of the first im not vain but im thankful  well now i always said it said matthew gazing at the pass list delightedly i knew you could beat them all easy  youve done pretty well i must say anne said marilla trying to hide her extreme pride in anne from mrs rachels critical eye but that good soul said heartily   i just guess she has done well and far be it from me to be backward in saying it youre a credit to your friends anne thats what and were all proud of you  that night anne who had wound up the delightful evening with a serious little talk with mrs allan at the manse knelt sweetly by her open window in a great sheen of moonshine and murmured a prayer of gratitude and aspiration that came straight from her heart there was in it thankfulness for the past and reverent petition for the future and when she slept on her white pillow her dreams were as fair and bright and beautiful as maidenhood might desire     chapter xxxiii the hotel concert   put on your white organdy by all means anne advised diana decidedly  they were together in the east gable chamber outside it was only twilight a lovely yellowish green twilight with a clear blue cloudless sky a big round moon slowly deepening from her pallid luster into burnished silver hung over the haunted wood the air was full of sweet summer sounds sleepy birds twittering freakish breezes faraway voices and laughter but in annes room the blind was drawn and the lamp lighted for an important toilet was being made  the east gable was a very different place from what it had been on that night four years before when anne had felt its bareness penetrate to the marrow of her spirit with its inhospitable chill changes had crept in marilla conniving at them resignedly until it was as sweet and dainty a nest as a young girl could desire  the velvet carpet with the pink roses and the pink silk curtains of annes early visions had certainly never materialized but her dreams had kept pace with her growth and it is not probable she lamented them the floor was covered with a pretty matting and the curtains that softened the high window and fluttered in the vagrant breezes were of pale green art muslin the walls hung not with gold and silver brocade tapestry but with a dainty apple blossom paper were adorned with a few good pictures given anne by mrs allan miss stacys photograph occupied the place of honor and anne made a sentimental point of keeping fresh flowers on the bracket under it tonight a spike of white lilies faintly perfumed the room like the dream of a fragrance there was no mahogany furniture but there was a white painted bookcase filled with books a cushioned wicker rocker a toilet table befrilled with white muslin a quaint gilt framed mirror with chubby pink cupids and purple grapes painted over its arched top that used to hang in the spare room and a low white bed  anne was dressing for a concert at the white sands hotel the guests had got it up in aid of the charlottetown hospital and had hunted out all the available amateur talent in the surrounding districts to help it along bertha sampson and pearl clay of the white sands baptist choir had been asked to sing a duet milton clark of newbridge was to give a violin solo winnie adella blair of carmody was to sing a scotch ballad and laura spencer of spencervale and anne shirley of avonlea were to recite  as anne would have said at one time it was an epoch in her life and she was deliciously athrill with the excitement of it matthew was in the seventh heaven of gratified pride over the honor conferred on his anne and marilla was not far behind although she would have died rather than admit it and said she didnt think it was very proper for a lot of young folks to be gadding over to the hotel without any responsible person with them  anne and diana were to drive over with jane andrews and her brother billy in their double seated buggy and several other avonlea girls and boys were going too there was a party of visitors expected out from town and after the concert a supper was to be given to the performers  do you really think the organdy will be best queried anne anxiously i dont think its as pretty as my blue flowered muslin and it certainly isnt so fashionable  but it suits you ever so much better said diana its so soft and frilly and clinging the muslin is stiff and makes you look too dressed up but the organdy seems as if it grew on you  anne sighed and yielded diana was beginning to have a reputation for notable taste in dressing and her advice on such subjects was much sought after she was looking very pretty herself on this particular night in a dress of the lovely wild rose pink from which anne was forever debarred but she was not to take any part in the concert so her appearance was of minor importance all her pains were bestowed upon anne who she vowed must for the credit of avonlea be dressed and combed and adorned to the queens taste  pull out that frill a little more so here let me tie your sash now for your slippers im going to braid your hair in two thick braids and tie them halfway up with big white bows no dont pull out a single curl over your forehead just have the soft part there is no way you do your hair suits you so well anne and mrs allan says you look like a madonna when you part it so i shall fasten this little white house rose just behind your ear there was just one on my bush and i saved it for you  shall i put my pearl beads on asked anne matthew brought me a string from town last week and i know hed like to see them on me  diana pursed up her lips put her black head on one side critically and finally pronounced in favor of the beads which were thereupon tied around annes slim milk white throat  theres something so stylish about you anne said diana with unenvious admiration you hold your head with such an air i suppose its your figure i am just a dumpling ive always been afraid of it and now i know it is so well i suppose i shall just have to resign myself to it  but you have such dimples said anne smiling affectionately into the pretty vivacious face so near her own lovely dimples like little dents in cream i have given up all hope of dimples my dimple dream will never come true but so many of my dreams have that i mustnt complain am i all ready now  all ready assured diana as marilla appeared in the doorway a gaunt figure with grayer hair than of yore and no fewer angles but with a much softer face come right in and look at our elocutionist marilla doesnt she look lovely  marilla emitted a sound between a sniff and a grunt  she looks neat and proper i like that way of fixing her hair but i expect shell ruin that dress driving over there in the dust and dew with it and it looks most too thin for these damp nights organdys the most unserviceable stuff in the world anyhow and i told matthew so when he got it but there is no use in saying anything to matthew nowadays time was when he would take my advice but now he just buys things for anne regardless and the clerks at carmody know they can palm anything off on him just let them tell him a thing is pretty and fashionable and matthew plunks his money down for it mind you keep your skirt clear of the wheel anne and put your warm jacket on  then marilla stalked downstairs thinking proudly how sweet anne looked with that       one moonbeam from the forehead to the crown  and regretting that she could not go to the concert herself to hear her girl recite  i wonder if it is too damp for my dress said anne anxiously  not a bit of it said diana pulling up the window blind its a perfect night and there wont be any dew look at the moonlight  im so glad my window looks east into the sun rising said anne going over to diana its so splendid to see the morning coming up over those long hills and glowing through those sharp fir tops its new every morning and i feel as if i washed my very soul in that bath of earliest sunshine oh diana i love this little room so dearly i dont know how ill get along without it when i go to town next month  dont speak of your going away tonight begged diana i dont want to think of it it makes me so miserable and i do want to have a good time this evening what are you going to recite anne and are you nervous  not a bit ive recited so often in public i dont mind at all now ive decided to give ‘the maidens vow its so pathetic laura spencer is going to give a comic recitation but id rather make people cry than laugh  what will you recite if they encore you  they wont dream of encoring me scoffed anne who was not without her own secret hopes that they would and already visioned herself telling matthew all about it at the next mornings breakfast table there are billy and jane now i hear the wheels come on  billy andrews insisted that anne should ride on the front seat with him so she unwillingly climbed up she would have much preferred to sit back with the girls where she could have laughed and chattered to her hearts content there was not much of either laughter or chatter in billy he was a big fat stolid youth of twenty with a round expressionless face and a painful lack of conversational gifts but he admired anne immensely and was puffed up with pride over the prospect of driving to white sands with that slim upright figure beside him  anne by dint of talking over her shoulder to the girls and occasionally passing a sop of civility to billy who grinned and chuckled and never could think of any reply until it was too late contrived to enjoy the drive in spite of all it was a night for enjoyment the road was full of buggies all bound for the hotel and laughter silver clear echoed and reechoed along it when they reached the hotel it was a blaze of light from top to bottom they were met by the ladies of the concert committee one of whom took anne off to the performers dressing room which was filled with the members of a charlottetown symphony club among whom anne felt suddenly shy and frightened and countrified her dress which in the east gable had seemed so dainty and pretty now seemed simple and plain too simple and plain she thought among all the silks and laces that glistened and rustled around her what were her pearl beads compared to the diamonds of the big handsome lady near her and how poor her one wee white rose must look beside all the hothouse flowers the others wore anne laid her hat and jacket away and shrank miserably into a corner she wished herself back in the white room at green gables  it was still worse on the platform of the big concert hall of the hotel where she presently found herself the electric lights dazzled her eyes the perfume and hum bewildered her she wished she were sitting down in the audience with diana and jane who seemed to be having a splendid time away at the back she was wedged in between a stout lady in pink silk and a tall scornful looking girl in a white lace dress the stout lady occasionally turned her head squarely around and surveyed anne through her eyeglasses until anne acutely sensitive of being so scrutinized felt that she must scream aloud and the white lace girl kept talking audibly to her next neighbor about the country bumpkins  and rustic belles in the audience languidly anticipating such fun  from the displays of local talent on the program anne believed that she would hate that white lace girl to the end of life  unfortunately for anne a professional elocutionist was staying at the hotel and had consented to recite she was a lithe dark eyed woman in a wonderful gown of shimmering gray stuff like woven moonbeams with gems on her neck and in her dark hair she had a marvelously flexible voice and wonderful power of expression the audience went wild over her selection anne forgetting all about herself and her troubles for the time listened with rapt and shining eyes but when the recitation ended she suddenly put her hands over her face she could never get up and recite after that never had she ever thought she could recite oh if she were only back at green gables  at this unpropitious moment her name was called somehow anne who did not notice the rather guilty little start of surprise the white lace girl gave and would not have understood the subtle compliment implied therein if she had got on her feet and moved dizzily out to the front she was so pale that diana and jane down in the audience clasped each others hands in nervous sympathy  anne was the victim of an overwhelming attack of stage fright often as she had recited in public she had never before faced such an audience as this and the sight of it paralyzed her energies completely everything was so strange so brilliant so bewildering the rows of ladies in evening dress the critical faces the whole atmosphere of wealth and culture about her very different this from the plain benches at the debating club filled with the homely sympathetic faces of friends and neighbors these people she thought would be merciless critics perhaps like the white lace girl they anticipated amusement from her rustic efforts she felt hopelessly helplessly ashamed and miserable her knees trembled her heart fluttered a horrible faintness came over her not a word could she utter and the next moment she would have fled from the platform despite the humiliation which she felt must ever after be her portion if she did so  but suddenly as her dilated frightened eyes gazed out over the audience she saw gilbert blythe away at the back of the room bending forward with a smile on his face a smile which seemed to anne at once triumphant and taunting in reality it was nothing of the kind gilbert was merely smiling with appreciation of the whole affair in general and of the effect produced by annes slender white form and spiritual face against a background of palms in particular josie pye whom he had driven over sat beside him and her face certainly was both triumphant and taunting but anne did not see josie and would not have cared if she had she drew a long breath and flung her head up proudly courage and determination tingling over her like an electric shock she would not fail before gilbert blythe he should never be able to laugh at her never never her fright and nervousness vanished and she began her recitation her clear sweet voice reaching to the farthest corner of the room without a tremor or a break self possession was fully restored to her and in the reaction from that horrible moment of powerlessness she recited as she had never done before when she finished there were bursts of honest applause anne stepping back to her seat blushing with shyness and delight found her hand vigorously clasped and shaken by the stout lady in pink silk  my dear you did splendidly she puffed ive been crying like a baby actually i have there theyre encoring you theyre bound to have you back  oh i cant go said anne confusedly but yet i must or matthew will be disappointed he said they would encore me  then dont disappoint matthew said the pink lady laughing  smiling blushing limpid eyed anne tripped back and gave a quaint funny little selection that captivated her audience still further the rest of the evening was quite a little triumph for her  when the concert was over the stout pink lady who was the wife of an american millionaire took her under her wing and introduced her to everybody and everybody was very nice to her the professional elocutionist mrs evans came and chatted with her telling her that she had a charming voice and interpreted her selections beautifully even the white lace girl paid her a languid little compliment they had supper in the big beautifully decorated dining room diana and jane were invited to partake of this also since they had come with anne but billy was nowhere to be found having decamped in mortal fear of some such invitation he was in waiting for them with the team however when it was all over and the three girls came merrily out into the calm white moonshine radiance anne breathed deeply and looked into the clear sky beyond the dark boughs of the firs  oh it was good to be out again in the purity and silence of the night how great and still and wonderful everything was with the murmur of the sea sounding through it and the darkling cliffs beyond like grim giants guarding enchanted coasts  hasnt it been a perfectly splendid time sighed jane as they drove away i just wish i was a rich american and could spend my summer at a hotel and wear jewels and low necked dresses and have ice cream and chicken salad every blessed day im sure it would be ever so much more fun than teaching school anne your recitation was simply great although i thought at first you were never going to begin i think it was better than mrs evanss  oh no dont say things like that jane said anne quickly because it sounds silly it couldnt be better than mrs evanss you know for she is a professional and im only a schoolgirl with a little knack of reciting im quite satisfied if the people just liked mine pretty well  ive a compliment for you anne said diana at least i think it must be a compliment because of the tone he said it in part of it was anyhow there was an american sitting behind jane and me such a romantic looking man with coal black hair and eyes josie pye says he is a distinguished artist and that her mothers cousin in boston is married to a man that used to go to school with him well we heard him say didnt we jane ‘who is that girl on the platform with the splendid titian hair she has a face i should like to paint there now anne but what does titian hair mean  being interpreted it means plain red i guess laughed anne titian was a very famous artist who liked to paint red haired women  did you see all the diamonds those ladies wore sighed jane they were simply dazzling wouldnt you just love to be rich girls  we are rich said anne staunchly why we have sixteen years to our credit and were happy as queens and weve all got imaginations more or less look at that sea girls all silver and shadow and vision of things not seen we couldnt enjoy its loveliness any more if we had millions of dollars and ropes of diamonds you wouldnt change into any of those women if you could would you want to be that white lace girl and wear a sour look all your life as if youd been born turning up your nose at the world or the pink lady kind and nice as she is so stout and short that youd really no figure at all or even mrs evans with that sad sad look in her eyes she must have been dreadfully unhappy sometime to have such a look you know you wouldnt jane andrews  i dont know exactly said jane unconvinced i think diamonds would comfort a person for a good deal  well i dont want to be anyone but myself even if i go uncomforted by diamonds all my life declared anne im quite content to be anne of green gables with my string of pearl beads i know matthew gave me as much love with them as ever went with madame the pink ladys jewels     chapter xxxiv a queens girl   the next three weeks were busy ones at green gables for anne was getting ready to go to queens and there was much sewing to be done and many things to be talked over and arranged annes outfit was ample and pretty for matthew saw to that and marilla for once made no objections whatever to anything he purchased or suggested more one evening she went up to the east gable with her arms full of a delicate pale green material  anne heres something for a nice light dress for you i dont suppose you really need it youve plenty of pretty waists but i thought maybe youd like something real dressy to wear if you were asked out anywhere of an evening in town to a party or anything like that i hear that jane and ruby and josie have got ‘evening dresses as they call them and i dont mean you shall be behind them i got mrs allan to help me pick it in town last week and well get emily gillis to make it for you emily has got taste and her fits arent to be equaled  oh marilla its just lovely said anne thank you so much i dont believe you ought to be so kind to me its making it harder every day for me to go away  the green dress was made up with as many tucks and frills and shirrings as emilys taste permitted anne put it on one evening for matthews and marillas benefit and recited the maidens vow for them in the kitchen as marilla watched the bright animated face and graceful motions her thoughts went back to the evening anne had arrived at green gables and memory recalled a vivid picture of the odd frightened child in her preposterous yellowish brown wincey dress the heartbreak looking out of her tearful eyes something in the memory brought tears to marillas own eyes  i declare my recitation has made you cry marilla said anne gaily stooping over marillas chair to drop a butterfly kiss on that ladys cheek now i call that a positive triumph  no i wasnt crying over your piece said marilla who would have scorned to be betrayed into such weakness by any poetry stuff i just couldnt help thinking of the little girl you used to be anne and i was wishing you could have stayed a little girl even with all your queer ways youve grown up now and youre going away and you look so tall and stylish and so so different altogether in that dress as if you didnt belong in avonlea at all and i just got lonesome thinking it all over  marilla anne sat down on marillas gingham lap took marillas lined face between her hands and looked gravely and tenderly into marillas eyes im not a bit changed not really im only just pruned down and branched out the real me back here is just the same it wont make a bit of difference where i go or how much i change outwardly at heart i shall always be your little anne who will love you and matthew and dear green gables more and better every day of her life  anne laid her fresh young cheek against marillas faded one and reached out a hand to pat matthews shoulder marilla would have given much just then to have possessed annes power of putting her feelings into words but nature and habit had willed it otherwise and she could only put her arms close about her girl and hold her tenderly to her heart wishing that she need never let her go  matthew with a suspicious moisture in his eyes got up and went out of doors under the stars of the blue summer night he walked agitatedly across the yard to the gate under the poplars  well now i guess she aint been much spoiled he muttered proudly i guess my putting in my oar occasional never did much harm after all shes smart and pretty and loving too which is better than all the rest shes been a blessing to us and there never was a luckier mistake than what mrs spencer made if it was luck i dont believe it was any such thing it was providence because the almighty saw we needed her i reckon  the day finally came when anne must go to town she and matthew drove in one fine september morning after a tearful parting with diana and an untearful practical one on marillas side at least with marilla but when anne had gone diana dried her tears and went to a beach picnic at white sands with some of her carmody cousins where she contrived to enjoy herself tolerably well while marilla plunged fiercely into unnecessary work and kept at it all day long with the bitterest kind of heartache the ache that burns and gnaws and cannot wash itself away in ready tears but that night when marilla went to bed acutely and miserably conscious that the little gable room at the end of the hall was untenanted by any vivid young life and unstirred by any soft breathing she buried her face in her pillow and wept for her girl in a passion of sobs that appalled her when she grew calm enough to reflect how very wicked it must be to take on so about a sinful fellow creature  anne and the rest of the avonlea scholars reached town just in time to hurry off to the academy that first day passed pleasantly enough in a whirl of excitement meeting all the new students learning to know the professors by sight and being assorted and organized into classes anne intended taking up the second year work being advised to do so by miss stacy gilbert blythe elected to do the same this meant getting a first class teachers license in one year instead of two if they were successful but it also meant much more and harder work jane ruby josie charlie and moody spurgeon not being troubled with the stirrings of ambition were content to take up the second class work anne was conscious of a pang of loneliness when she found herself in a room with fifty other students not one of whom she knew except the tall brown haired boy across the room and knowing him in the fashion she did did not help her much as she reflected pessimistically yet she was undeniably glad that they were in the same class the old rivalry could still be carried on and anne would hardly have known what to do if it had been lacking  i wouldnt feel comfortable without it she thought gilbert looks awfully determined i suppose hes making up his mind here and now to win the medal what a splendid chin he has i never noticed it before i do wish jane and ruby had gone in for first class too i suppose i wont feel so much like a cat in a strange garret when i get acquainted though i wonder which of the girls here are going to be my friends its really an interesting speculation of course i promised diana that no queens girl no matter how much i liked her should ever be as dear to me as she is but ive lots of second best affections to bestow i like the look of that girl with the brown eyes and the crimson waist she looks vivid and red rosy theres that pale fair one gazing out of the window she has lovely hair and looks as if she knew a thing or two about dreams id like to know them both know them well well enough to walk with my arm about their waists and call them nicknames but just now i dont know them and they dont know me and probably dont want to know me particularly oh its lonesome  it was lonesomer still when anne found herself alone in her hall bedroom that night at twilight she was not to board with the other girls who all had relatives in town to take pity on them miss josephine barry would have liked to board her but beechwood was so far from the academy that it was out of the question so miss barry hunted up a boarding house assuring matthew and marilla that it was the very place for anne  the lady who keeps it is a reduced gentlewoman explained miss barry her husband was a british officer and she is very careful what sort of boarders she takes anne will not meet with any objectionable persons under her roof the table is good and the house is near the academy in a quiet neighborhood  all this might be quite true and indeed proved to be so but it did not materially help anne in the first agony of homesickness that seized upon her she looked dismally about her narrow little room with its dull papered pictureless walls its small iron bedstead and empty bookcase and a horrible choke came into her throat as she thought of her own white room at green gables where she would have the pleasant consciousness of a great green still outdoors of sweet peas growing in the garden and moonlight falling on the orchard of the brook below the slope and the spruce boughs tossing in the night wind beyond it of a vast starry sky and the light from dianas window shining out through the gap in the trees here there was nothing of this anne knew that outside of her window was a hard street with a network of telephone wires shutting out the sky the tramp of alien feet and a thousand lights gleaming on stranger faces she knew that she was going to cry and fought against it  i wont cry its silly and weak theres the third tear splashing down by my nose there are more coming i must think of something funny to stop them but theres nothing funny except what is connected with avonlea and that only makes things worse four five im going home next friday but that seems a hundred years away oh matthew is nearly home by now and marilla is at the gate looking down the lane for him six seven eight oh theres no use in counting them theyre coming in a flood presently i cant cheer up i dont want to cheer up its nicer to be miserable  the flood of tears would have come no doubt had not josie pye appeared at that moment in the joy of seeing a familiar face anne forgot that there had never been much love lost between her and josie as a part of avonlea life even a pye was welcome  im so glad you came up anne said sincerely  youve been crying remarked josie with aggravating pity i suppose youre homesick some people have so little self control in that respect ive no intention of being homesick i can tell you towns too jolly after that poky old avonlea i wonder how i ever existed there so long you shouldnt cry anne it isnt becoming for your nose and eyes get red and then you seem all red id a perfectly scrumptious time in the academy today our french professor is simply a duck his moustache would give you kerwollowps of the heart have you anything eatable around anne im literally starving ah i guessed likely marilla ‘d load you up with cake thats why i called round otherwise id have gone to the park to hear the band play with frank stockley he boards same place as i do and hes a sport he noticed you in class today and asked me who the red headed girl was i told him you were an orphan that the cuthberts had adopted and nobody knew very much about what youd been before that  anne was wondering if after all solitude and tears were not more satisfactory than josie pyes companionship when jane and ruby appeared each with an inch of queens color ribbon purple and scarlet pinned proudly to her coat as josie was not speaking to jane just then she had to subside into comparative harmlessness  well said jane with a sigh i feel as if id lived many moons since the morning i ought to be home studying my virgil that horrid old professor gave us twenty lines to start in on tomorrow but i simply couldnt settle down to study tonight anne methinks i see the traces of tears if youve been crying do own up it will restore my self respect for i was shedding tears freely before ruby came along i dont mind being a goose so much if somebody else is goosey too cake youll give me a teeny piece wont you thank you it has the real avonlea flavor  ruby perceiving the queens calendar lying on the table wanted to know if anne meant to try for the gold medal  anne blushed and admitted she was thinking of it  oh that reminds me said josie queens is to get one of the avery scholarships after all the word came today frank stockley told me his uncle is one of the board of governors you know it will be announced in the academy tomorrow  an avery scholarship anne felt her heart beat more quickly and the horizons of her ambition shifted and broadened as if by magic before josie had told the news annes highest pinnacle of aspiration had been a teachers provincial license first class at the end of the year and perhaps the medal but now in one moment anne saw herself winning the avery scholarship taking an arts course at redmond college and graduating in a gown and mortar board before the echo of josies words had died away for the avery scholarship was in english and anne felt that here her foot was on native heath  a wealthy manufacturer of new brunswick had died and left part of his fortune to endow a large number of scholarships to be distributed among the various high schools and academies of the maritime provinces according to their respective standings there had been much doubt whether one would be allotted to queens but the matter was settled at last and at the end of the year the graduate who made the highest mark in english and english literature would win the scholarship two hundred and fifty dollars a year for four years at redmond college no wonder that anne went to bed that night with tingling cheeks  ill win that scholarship if hard work can do it she resolved wouldnt matthew be proud if i got to be a ba oh its delightful to have ambitions im so glad i have such a lot and there never seems to be any end to them thats the best of it just as soon as you attain to one ambition you see another one glittering higher up still it does make life so interesting     chapter xxxv the winter at queens   annes homesickness wore off greatly helped in the wearing by her weekend visits home as long as the open weather lasted the avonlea students went out to carmody on the new branch railway every friday night diana and several other avonlea young folks were generally on hand to meet them and they all walked over to avonlea in a merry party anne thought those friday evening gypsyings over the autumnal hills in the crisp golden air with the homelights of avonlea twinkling beyond were the best and dearest hours in the whole week  gilbert blythe nearly always walked with ruby gillis and carried her satchel for her ruby was a very handsome young lady now thinking herself quite as grown up as she really was she wore her skirts as long as her mother would let her and did her hair up in town though she had to take it down when she went home she had large bright blue eyes a brilliant complexion and a plump showy figure she laughed a great deal was cheerful and good tempered and enjoyed the pleasant things of life frankly  but i shouldnt think she was the sort of girl gilbert would like  whispered jane to anne anne did not think so either but she would not have said so for the avery scholarship she could not help thinking too that it would be very pleasant to have such a friend as gilbert to jest and chatter with and exchange ideas about books and studies and ambitions gilbert had ambitions she knew and ruby gillis did not seem the sort of person with whom such could be profitably discussed  there was no silly sentiment in annes ideas concerning gilbert boys were to her when she thought about them at all merely possible good comrades if she and gilbert had been friends she would not have cared how many other friends he had nor with whom he walked she had a genius for friendship girl friends she had in plenty but she had a vague consciousness that masculine friendship might also be a good thing to round out ones conceptions of companionship and furnish broader standpoints of judgment and comparison not that anne could have put her feelings on the matter into just such clear definition but she thought that if gilbert had ever walked home with her from the train over the crisp fields and along the ferny byways they might have had many and merry and interesting conversations about the new world that was opening around them and their hopes and ambitions therein gilbert was a clever young fellow with his own thoughts about things and a determination to get the best out of life and put the best into it ruby gillis told jane andrews that she didnt understand half the things gilbert blythe said he talked just like anne shirley did when she had a thoughtful fit on and for her part she didnt think it any fun to be bothering about books and that sort of thing when you didnt have to frank stockley had lots more dash and go but then he wasnt half as good looking as gilbert and she really couldnt decide which she liked best  in the academy anne gradually drew a little circle of friends about her thoughtful imaginative ambitious students like herself with the rose red girl stella maynard and the dream girl priscilla grant she soon became intimate finding the latter pale spiritual looking maiden to be full to the brim of mischief and pranks and fun while the vivid black eyed stella had a heartful of wistful dreams and fancies as aerial and rainbow like as annes own  after the christmas holidays the avonlea students gave up going home on fridays and settled down to hard work by this time all the queens scholars had gravitated into their own places in the ranks and the various classes had assumed distinct and settled shadings of individuality certain facts had become generally accepted it was admitted that the medal contestants had practically narrowed down to three gilbert blythe anne shirley and lewis wilson the avery scholarship was more doubtful any one of a certain six being a possible winner the bronze medal for mathematics was considered as good as won by a fat funny little up country boy with a bumpy forehead and a patched coat  ruby gillis was the handsomest girl of the year at the academy in the second year classes stella maynard carried off the palm for beauty with small but critical minority in favor of anne shirley ethel marr was admitted by all competent judges to have the most stylish modes of hair dressing and jane andrews plain plodding conscientious jane carried off the honors in the domestic science course even josie pye attained a certain preeminence as the sharpest tongued young lady in attendance at queens so it may be fairly stated that miss stacys old pupils held their own in the wider arena of the academical course  anne worked hard and steadily her rivalry with gilbert was as intense as it had ever been in avonlea school although it was not known in the class at large but somehow the bitterness had gone out of it anne no longer wished to win for the sake of defeating gilbert rather for the proud consciousness of a well won victory over a worthy foeman it would be worth while to win but she no longer thought life would be insupportable if she did not  in spite of lessons the students found opportunities for pleasant times anne spent many of her spare hours at beechwood and generally ate her sunday dinners there and went to church with miss barry the latter was as she admitted growing old but her black eyes were not dim nor the vigor of her tongue in the least abated but she never sharpened the latter on anne who continued to be a prime favorite with the critical old lady  that anne girl improves all the time she said i get tired of other girls there is such a provoking and eternal sameness about them anne has as many shades as a rainbow and every shade is the prettiest while it lasts i dont know that she is as amusing as she was when she was a child but she makes me love her and i like people who make me love them it saves me so much trouble in making myself love them  then almost before anybody realized it spring had come out in avonlea the mayflowers were peeping pinkly out on the sere barrens where snow wreaths lingered and the mist of green was on the woods and in the valleys but in charlottetown harassed queens students thought and talked only of examinations  it doesnt seem possible that the term is nearly over said anne why last fall it seemed so long to look forward to a whole winter of studies and classes and here we are with the exams looming up next week girls sometimes i feel as if those exams meant everything but when i look at the big buds swelling on those chestnut trees and the misty blue air at the end of the streets they dont seem half so important  jane and ruby and josie who had dropped in did not take this view of it to them the coming examinations were constantly very important indeed far more important than chestnut buds or maytime hazes it was all very well for anne who was sure of passing at least to have her moments of belittling them but when your whole future depended on them as the girls truly thought theirs did you could not regard them philosophically  ive lost seven pounds in the last two weeks sighed jane its no use to say dont worry i will worry worrying helps you some it seems as if you were doing something when youre worrying it would be dreadful if i failed to get my license after going to queens all winter and spending so much money  i dont care said josie pye if i dont pass this year im coming back next my father can afford to send me anne frank stockley says that professor tremaine said gilbert blythe was sure to get the medal and that emily clay would likely win the avery scholarship  that may make me feel badly tomorrow josie laughed anne but just now i honestly feel that as long as i know the violets are coming out all purple down in the hollow below green gables and that little ferns are poking their heads up in lovers lane its not a great deal of difference whether i win the avery or not ive done my best and i begin to understand what is meant by the ‘joy of the strife next to trying and winning the best thing is trying and failing girls dont talk about exams look at that arch of pale green sky over those houses and picture to yourself what it must look like over the purply dark beech woods back of avonlea  what are you going to wear for commencement jane asked ruby practically  jane and josie both answered at once and the chatter drifted into a side eddy of fashions but anne with her elbows on the window sill her soft cheek laid against her clasped hands and her eyes filled with visions looked out unheedingly across city roof and spire to that glorious dome of sunset sky and wove her dreams of a possible future from the golden tissue of youths own optimism all the beyond was hers with its possibilities lurking rosily in the oncoming years each year a rose of promise to be woven into an immortal chaplet     chapter xxxvi the glory and the dream   on the morning when the final results of all the examinations were to be posted on the bulletin board at queens anne and jane walked down the street together jane was smiling and happy examinations were over and she was comfortably sure she had made a pass at least further considerations troubled jane not at all she had no soaring ambitions and consequently was not affected with the unrest attendant thereon for we pay a price for everything we get or take in this world and although ambitions are well worth having they are not to be cheaply won but exact their dues of work and self denial anxiety and discouragement anne was pale and quiet in ten more minutes she would know who had won the medal and who the avery beyond those ten minutes there did not seem just then to be anything worth being called time  of course youll win one of them anyhow said jane who couldnt understand how the faculty could be so unfair as to order it otherwise  i have not hope of the avery said anne everybody says emily clay will win it and im not going to march up to that bulletin board and look at it before everybody i havent the moral courage im going straight to the girls dressing room you must read the announcements and then come and tell me jane and i implore you in the name of our old friendship to do it as quickly as possible if i have failed just say so without trying to break it gently and whatever you do dont sympathize with me promise me this jane  jane promised solemnly but as it happened there was no necessity for such a promise when they went up the entrance steps of queens they found the hall full of boys who were carrying gilbert blythe around on their shoulders and yelling at the tops of their voices hurrah for blythe medalist  for a moment anne felt one sickening pang of defeat and disappointment so she had failed and gilbert had won well matthew would be sorry he had been so sure she would win  and then  somebody called out   three cheers for miss shirley winner of the avery  oh anne gasped jane as they fled to the girls dressing room amid hearty cheers oh anne im so proud isnt it splendid  and then the girls were around them and anne was the center of a laughing congratulating group her shoulders were thumped and her hands shaken vigorously she was pushed and pulled and hugged and among it all she managed to whisper to jane   oh wont matthew and marilla be pleased i must write the news home right away  commencement was the next important happening the exercises were held in the big assembly hall of the academy addresses were given essays read songs sung the public award of diplomas prizes and medals made  matthew and marilla were there with eyes and ears for only one student on the platform a tall girl in pale green with faintly flushed cheeks and starry eyes who read the best essay and was pointed out and whispered about as the avery winner  reckon youre glad we kept her marilla whispered matthew speaking for the first time since he had entered the hall when anne had finished her essay  its not the first time ive been glad retorted marilla you do like to rub things in matthew cuthbert  miss barry who was sitting behind them leaned forward and poked marilla in the back with her parasol  arent you proud of that anne girl i am she said  anne went home to avonlea with matthew and marilla that evening she had not been home since april and she felt that she could not wait another day the apple blossoms were out and the world was fresh and young diana was at green gables to meet her in her own white room where marilla had set a flowering house rose on the window sill anne looked about her and drew a long breath of happiness  oh diana its so good to be back again its so good to see those pointed firs coming out against the pink sky and that white orchard and the old snow queen isnt the breath of the mint delicious and that tea rose why its a song and a hope and a prayer all in one and its good to see you again diana  i thought you liked that stella maynard better than me said diana reproachfully josie pye told me you did josie said you were infatuated with her  anne laughed and pelted diana with the faded june lilies of her bouquet  stella maynard is the dearest girl in the world except one and you are that one diana she said i love you more than ever and ive so many things to tell you but just now i feel as if it were joy enough to sit here and look at you im tired i think tired of being studious and ambitious i mean to spend at least two hours tomorrow lying out in the orchard grass thinking of absolutely nothing  youve done splendidly anne i suppose you wont be teaching now that youve won the avery  no im going to redmond in september doesnt it seem wonderful ill have a brand new stock of ambition laid in by that time after three glorious golden months of vacation jane and ruby are going to teach isnt it splendid to think we all got through even to moody spurgeon and josie pye  the newbridge trustees have offered jane their school already said diana gilbert blythe is going to teach too he has to his father cant afford to send him to college next year after all so he means to earn his own way through i expect hell get the school here if miss ames decides to leave  anne felt a queer little sensation of dismayed surprise she had not known this she had expected that gilbert would be going to redmond also what would she do without their inspiring rivalry would not work even at a coeducational college with a real degree in prospect be rather flat without her friend the enemy  the next morning at breakfast it suddenly struck anne that matthew was not looking well surely he was much grayer than he had been a year before  marilla she said hesitatingly when he had gone out is matthew quite well  no he isnt said marilla in a troubled tone hes had some real bad spells with his heart this spring and he wont spare himself a mite ive been real worried about him but hes some better this while back and weve got a good hired man so im hoping hell kind of rest and pick up maybe he will now youre home you always cheer him up  anne leaned across the table and took marillas face in her hands  you are not looking as well yourself as id like to see you marilla you look tired im afraid youve been working too hard you must take a rest now that im home im just going to take this one day off to visit all the dear old spots and hunt up my old dreams and then it will be your turn to be lazy while i do the work  marilla smiled affectionately at her girl  its not the work its my head ive got a pain so often now behind my eyes doctor spencers been fussing with glasses but they dont do me any good there is a distinguished oculist coming to the island the last of june and the doctor says i must see him i guess ill have to i cant read or sew with any comfort now well anne youve done real well at queens i must say to take first class license in one year and win the avery scholarship well well mrs lynde says pride goes before a fall and she doesnt believe in the higher education of women at all she says it unfits them for womans true sphere i dont believe a word of it speaking of rachel reminds me did you hear anything about the abbey bank lately anne  i heard it was shaky answered anne why  that is what rachel said she was up here one day last week and said there was some talk about it matthew felt real worried all we have saved is in that bank every penny i wanted matthew to put it in the savings bank in the first place but old mr abbey was a great friend of fathers and hed always banked with him matthew said any bank with him at the head of it was good enough for anybody  i think he has only been its nominal head for many years said anne he is a very old man his nephews are really at the head of the institution  well when rachel told us that i wanted matthew to draw our money right out and he said hed think of it but mr russell told him yesterday that the bank was all right  anne had her good day in the companionship of the outdoor world she never forgot that day it was so bright and golden and fair so free from shadow and so lavish of blossom anne spent some of its rich hours in the orchard she went to the dryads bubble and willowmere and violet vale she called at the manse and had a satisfying talk with mrs allan and finally in the evening she went with matthew for the cows through lovers lane to the back pasture the woods were all gloried through with sunset and the warm splendor of it streamed down through the hill gaps in the west matthew walked slowly with bent head anne tall and erect suited her springing step to his  youve been working too hard today matthew she said reproachfully why wont you take things easier  well now i cant seem to said matthew as he opened the yard gate to let the cows through its only that im getting old anne and keep forgetting it well well ive always worked pretty hard and id rather drop in harness  if i had been the boy you sent for said anne wistfully id be able to help you so much now and spare you in a hundred ways i could find it in my heart to wish i had been just for that  well now id rather have you than a dozen boys anne said matthew patting her hand just mind you that rather than a dozen boys well now i guess it wasnt a boy that took the avery scholarship was it it was a girl my girl my girl that im proud of  he smiled his shy smile at her as he went into the yard anne took the memory of it with her when she went to her room that night and sat for a long while at her open window thinking of the past and dreaming of the future outside the snow queen was mistily white in the moonshine the frogs were singing in the marsh beyond orchard slope anne always remembered the silvery peaceful beauty and fragrant calm of that night it was the last night before sorrow touched her life and no life is ever quite the same again when once that cold sanctifying touch has been laid upon it     chapter xxxvii the reaper whose name is death   matthew matthew what is the matter matthew are you sick  it was marilla who spoke alarm in every jerky word anne came through the hall her hands full of white narcissus it was long before anne could love the sight or odor of white narcissus again in time to hear her and to see matthew standing in the porch doorway a folded paper in his hand and his face strangely drawn and gray anne dropped her flowers and sprang across the kitchen to him at the same moment as marilla they were both too late before they could reach him matthew had fallen across the threshold  hes fainted gasped marilla anne run for martin quick quick hes at the barn  martin the hired man who had just driven home from the post office started at once for the doctor calling at orchard slope on his way to send mr and mrs barry over mrs lynde who was there on an errand came too they found anne and marilla distractedly trying to restore matthew to consciousness  mrs lynde pushed them gently aside tried his pulse and then laid her ear over his heart she looked at their anxious faces sorrowfully and the tears came into her eyes  oh marilla she said gravely i dont think we can do anything for him  mrs lynde you dont think you cant think matthew is is  anne could not say the dreadful word she turned sick and pallid  child yes im afraid of it look at his face when youve seen that look as often as i have youll know what it means  anne looked at the still face and there beheld the seal of the great presence  when the doctor came he said that death had been instantaneous and probably painless caused in all likelihood by some sudden shock the secret of the shock was discovered to be in the paper matthew had held and which martin had brought from the office that morning it contained an account of the failure of the abbey bank  the news spread quickly through avonlea and all day friends and neighbors thronged green gables and came and went on errands of kindness for the dead and living for the first time shy quiet matthew cuthbert was a person of central importance the white majesty of death had fallen on him and set him apart as one crowned  when the calm night came softly down over green gables the old house was hushed and tranquil in the parlor lay matthew cuthbert in his coffin his long gray hair framing his placid face on which there was a little kindly smile as if he but slept dreaming pleasant dreams there were flowers about him sweet old fashioned flowers which his mother had planted in the homestead garden in her bridal days and for which matthew had always had a secret wordless love anne had gathered them and brought them to him her anguished tearless eyes burning in her white face it was the last thing she could do for him  the barrys and mrs lynde stayed with them that night diana going to the east gable where anne was standing at her window said gently   anne dear would you like to have me sleep with you tonight  thank you diana anne looked earnestly into her friends face i think you wont misunderstand me when i say i want to be alone im not afraid i havent been alone one minute since it happened and i want to be i want to be quite silent and quiet and try to realize it i cant realize it half the time it seems to me that matthew cant be dead and the other half it seems as if he must have been dead for a long time and ive had this horrible dull ache ever since  diana did not quite understand marillas impassioned grief breaking all the bounds of natural reserve and lifelong habit in its stormy rush she could comprehend better than annes tearless agony but she went away kindly leaving anne alone to keep her first vigil with sorrow  anne hoped that the tears would come in solitude it seemed to her a terrible thing that she could not shed a tear for matthew whom she had loved so much and who had been so kind to her matthew who had walked with her last evening at sunset and was now lying in the dim room below with that awful peace on his brow but no tears came at first even when she knelt by her window in the darkness and prayed looking up to the stars beyond the hills no tears only the same horrible dull ache of misery that kept on aching until she fell asleep worn out with the days pain and excitement  in the night she awakened with the stillness and the darkness about her and the recollection of the day came over her like a wave of sorrow she could see matthews face smiling at her as he had smiled when they parted at the gate that last evening she could hear his voice saying my girl my girl that im proud of then the tears came and anne wept her heart out marilla heard her and crept in to comfort her  there there dont cry so dearie it cant bring him back it it isnt right to cry so i knew that today but i couldnt help it then hed always been such a good kind brother to me but god knows best  oh just let me cry marilla sobbed anne the tears dont hurt me like that ache did stay here for a little while with me and keep your arm round me so i couldnt have diana stay shes good and kind and sweet but its not her sorrow shes outside of it and she couldnt come close enough to my heart to help me its our sorrow yours and mine oh marilla what will we do without him  weve got each other anne i dont know what id do if you werent here if youd never come oh anne i know ive been kind of strict and harsh with you maybe but you mustnt think i didnt love you as well as matthew did for all that i want to tell you now when i can its never been easy for me to say things out of my heart but at times like this its easier i love you as dear as if you were my own flesh and blood and youve been my joy and comfort ever since you came to green gables  two days afterwards they carried matthew cuthbert over his homestead threshold and away from the fields he had tilled and the orchards he had loved and the trees he had planted and then avonlea settled back to its usual placidity and even at green gables affairs slipped into their old groove and work was done and duties fulfilled with regularity as before although always with the aching sense of loss in all familiar things  anne new to grief thought it almost sad that it could be so that they could go on in the old way without matthew she felt something like shame and remorse when she discovered that the sunrises behind the firs and the pale pink buds opening in the garden gave her the old inrush of gladness when she saw them that dianas visits were pleasant to her and that dianas merry words and ways moved her to laughter and smiles that in brief the beautiful world of blossom and love and friendship had lost none of its power to please her fancy and thrill her heart that life still called to her with many insistent voices  it seems like disloyalty to matthew somehow to find pleasure in these things now that he has gone she said wistfully to mrs allan one evening when they were together in the manse garden i miss him so much all the time and yet mrs allan the world and life seem very beautiful and interesting to me for all today diana said something funny and i found myself laughing i thought when it happened i could never laugh again and it somehow seems as if i oughtnt to  when matthew was here he liked to hear you laugh and he liked to know that you found pleasure in the pleasant things around you said mrs allan gently he is just away now and he likes to know it just the same i am sure we should not shut our hearts against the healing influences that nature offers us but i can understand your feeling i think we all experience the same thing we resent the thought that anything can please us when someone we love is no longer here to share the pleasure with us and we almost feel as if we were unfaithful to our sorrow when we find our interest in life returning to us  i was down to the graveyard to plant a rosebush on matthews grave this afternoon said anne dreamily i took a slip of the little white scotch rosebush his mother brought out from scotland long ago matthew always liked those roses the best they were so small and sweet on their thorny stems it made me feel glad that i could plant it by his grave as if i were doing something that must please him in taking it there to be near him i hope he has roses like them in heaven perhaps the souls of all those little white roses that he has loved so many summers were all there to meet him i must go home now marilla is all alone and she gets lonely at twilight  she will be lonelier still i fear when you go away again to college  said mrs allan  anne did not reply she said good night and went slowly back to green gables marilla was sitting on the front door steps and anne sat down beside her the door was open behind them held back by a big pink conch shell with hints of sea sunsets in its smooth inner convolutions  anne gathered some sprays of pale yellow honeysuckle and put them in her hair she liked the delicious hint of fragrance as some aerial benediction above her every time she moved  doctor spencer was here while you were away marilla said he says that the specialist will be in town tomorrow and he insists that i must go in and have my eyes examined i suppose id better go and have it over ill be more than thankful if the man can give me the right kind of glasses to suit my eyes you wont mind staying here alone while im away will you martin will have to drive me in and theres ironing and baking to do  i shall be all right diana will come over for company for me i shall attend to the ironing and baking beautifully you neednt fear that ill starch the handkerchiefs or flavor the cake with liniment  marilla laughed  what a girl you were for making mistakes in them days anne you were always getting into scrapes i did use to think you were possessed do you mind the time you dyed your hair  yes indeed i shall never forget it smiled anne touching the heavy braid of hair that was wound about her shapely head i laugh a little now sometimes when i think what a worry my hair used to be to me but i dont laugh much because it was a very real trouble then i did suffer terribly over my hair and my freckles my freckles are really gone and people are nice enough to tell me my hair is auburn now all but josie pye she informed me yesterday that she really thought it was redder than ever or at least my black dress made it look redder and she asked me if people who had red hair ever got used to having it marilla ive almost decided to give up trying to like josie pye ive made what i would once have called a heroic effort to like her but josie pye wont be liked  josie is a pye said marilla sharply so she cant help being disagreeable i suppose people of that kind serve some useful purpose in society but i must say i dont know what it is any more than i know the use of thistles is josie going to teach  no she is going back to queens next year so are moody spurgeon and charlie sloane jane and ruby are going to teach and they have both got schools jane at newbridge and ruby at some place up west  gilbert blythe is going to teach too isnt he  yes briefly  what a nice looking fellow he is said marilla absently i saw him in church last sunday and he seemed so tall and manly he looks a lot like his father did at the same age john blythe was a nice boy we used to be real good friends he and i people called him my beau  anne looked up with swift interest  oh marilla and what happened why didnt you   we had a quarrel i wouldnt forgive him when he asked me to i meant to after awhile but i was sulky and angry and i wanted to punish him first he never came back the blythes were all mighty independent but i always felt rather sorry ive always kind of wished id forgiven him when i had the chance  so youve had a bit of romance in your life too said anne softly  yes i suppose you might call it that you wouldnt think so to look at me would you but you never can tell about people from their outsides everybody has forgot about me and john id forgotten myself but it all came back to me when i saw gilbert last sunday     chapter xxxviii the bend in the road   marilla went to town the next day and returned in the evening anne had gone over to orchard slope with diana and came back to find marilla in the kitchen sitting by the table with her head leaning on her hand something in her dejected attitude struck a chill to annes heart she had never seen marilla sit limply inert like that  are you very tired marilla  yes no i dont know said marilla wearily looking up i suppose i am tired but i havent thought about it its not that  did you see the oculist what did he say asked anne anxiously  yes i saw him he examined my eyes he says that if i give up all reading and sewing entirely and any kind of work that strains the eyes and if im careful not to cry and if i wear the glasses hes given me he thinks my eyes may not get any worse and my headaches will be cured but if i dont he says ill certainly be stone blind in six months blind anne just think of it  for a minute anne after her first quick exclamation of dismay was silent it seemed to her that she could not speak then she said bravely but with a catch in her voice   marilla dont think of it you know he has given you hope if you are careful you wont lose your sight altogether and if his glasses cure your headaches it will be a great thing  i dont call it much hope said marilla bitterly what am i to live for if i cant read or sew or do anything like that i might as well be blind or dead and as for crying i cant help that when i get lonesome but there its no good talking about it if youll get me a cup of tea ill be thankful im about done out dont say anything about this to any one for a spell yet anyway i cant bear that folks should come here to question and sympathize and talk about it  when marilla had eaten her lunch anne persuaded her to go to bed then anne went herself to the east gable and sat down by her window in the darkness alone with her tears and her heaviness of heart how sadly things had changed since she had sat there the night after coming home then she had been full of hope and joy and the future had looked rosy with promise anne felt as if she had lived years since then but before she went to bed there was a smile on her lips and peace in her heart she had looked her duty courageously in the face and found it a friend as duty ever is when we meet it frankly  one afternoon a few days later marilla came slowly in from the front yard where she had been talking to a caller a man whom anne knew by sight as sadler from carmody anne wondered what he could have been saying to bring that look to marillas face  what did mr sadler want marilla  marilla sat down by the window and looked at anne there were tears in her eyes in defiance of the oculists prohibition and her voice broke as she said   he heard that i was going to sell green gables and he wants to buy it  buy it buy green gables anne wondered if she had heard aright oh marilla you dont mean to sell green gables  anne i dont know what else is to be done ive thought it all over if my eyes were strong i could stay here and make out to look after things and manage with a good hired man but as it is i cant i may lose my sight altogether and anyway ill not be fit to run things oh i never thought id live to see the day when id have to sell my home but things would only go behind worse and worse all the time till nobody would want to buy it every cent of our money went in that bank and theres some notes matthew gave last fall to pay mrs lynde advises me to sell the farm and board somewhere with her i suppose it wont bring much its small and the buildings are old but itll be enough for me to live on i reckon im thankful youre provided for with that scholarship anne im sorry you wont have a home to come to in your vacations thats all but i suppose youll manage somehow  marilla broke down and wept bitterly  you mustnt sell green gables said anne resolutely  oh anne i wish i didnt have to but you can see for yourself i cant stay here alone id go crazy with trouble and loneliness and my sight would go i know it would  you wont have to stay here alone marilla ill be with you im not going to redmond  not going to redmond marilla lifted her worn face from her hands and looked at anne why what do you mean  just what i say im not going to take the scholarship i decided so the night after you came home from town you surely dont think i could leave you alone in your trouble marilla after all youve done for me ive been thinking and planning let me tell you my plans mr barry wants to rent the farm for next year so you wont have any bother over that and im going to teach ive applied for the school here but i dont expect to get it for i understand the trustees have promised it to gilbert blythe but i can have the carmody school mr blair told me so last night at the store of course that wont be quite as nice or convenient as if i had the avonlea school but i can board home and drive myself over to carmody and back in the warm weather at least and even in winter i can come home fridays well keep a horse for that oh i have it all planned out marilla and ill read to you and keep you cheered up you shant be dull or lonesome and well be real cozy and happy here together you and i  marilla had listened like a woman in a dream  oh anne i could get on real well if you were here i know but i cant let you sacrifice yourself so for me it would be terrible  nonsense anne laughed merrily there is no sacrifice nothing could be worse than giving up green gables nothing could hurt me more we must keep the dear old place my mind is quite made up marilla im not going to redmond and i am going to stay here and teach dont you worry about me a bit  but your ambitions and   im just as ambitious as ever only ive changed the object of my ambitions im going to be a good teacher and im going to save your eyesight besides i mean to study at home here and take a little college course all by myself oh ive dozens of plans marilla ive been thinking them out for a week i shall give life here my best and i believe it will give its best to me in return when i left queens my future seemed to stretch out before me like a straight road i thought i could see along it for many a milestone now there is a bend in it i dont know what lies around the bend but im going to believe that the best does it has a fascination of its own that bend marilla i wonder how the road beyond it goes what there is of green glory and soft checkered light and shadows what new landscapes what new beauties what curves and hills and valleys further on  i dont feel as if i ought to let you give it up said marilla referring to the scholarship  but you cant prevent me im sixteen and a half ‘obstinate as a mule as mrs lynde once told me laughed anne oh marilla dont you go pitying me i dont like to be pitied and there is no need for it im heart glad over the very thought of staying at dear green gables nobody could love it as you and i do so we must keep it  you blessed girl said marilla yielding i feel as if youd given me new life i guess i ought to stick out and make you go to college but i know i cant so i aint going to try ill make it up to you though anne  when it became noised abroad in avonlea that anne shirley had given up the idea of going to college and intended to stay home and teach there was a good deal of discussion over it most of the good folks not knowing about marillas eyes thought she was foolish mrs allan did not she told anne so in approving words that brought tears of pleasure to the girls eyes neither did good mrs lynde she came up one evening and found anne and marilla sitting at the front door in the warm scented summer dusk they liked to sit there when the twilight came down and the white moths flew about in the garden and the odor of mint filled the dewy air  mrs rachel deposited her substantial person upon the stone bench by the door behind which grew a row of tall pink and yellow hollyhocks with a long breath of mingled weariness and relief  i declare im getting glad to sit down ive been on my feet all day and two hundred pounds is a good bit for two feet to carry round its a great blessing not to be fat marilla i hope you appreciate it well anne i hear youve given up your notion of going to college i was real glad to hear it youve got as much education now as a woman can be comfortable with i dont believe in girls going to college with the men and cramming their heads full of latin and greek and all that nonsense  but im going to study latin and greek just the same mrs lynde said anne laughing im going to take my arts course right here at green gables and study everything that i would at college  mrs lynde lifted her hands in holy horror  anne shirley youll kill yourself  not a bit of it i shall thrive on it oh im not going to overdo things as ‘josiah allens wife says i shall be ‘mejum but ill have lots of spare time in the long winter evenings and ive no vocation for fancy work im going to teach over at carmody you know  i dont know it i guess youre going to teach right here in avonlea the trustees have decided to give you the school  mrs lynde cried anne springing to her feet in her surprise why i thought they had promised it to gilbert blythe  so they did but as soon as gilbert heard that you had applied for it he went to them they had a business meeting at the school last night you know and told them that he withdrew his application and suggested that they accept yours he said he was going to teach at white sands of course he knew how much you wanted to stay with marilla and i must say i think it was real kind and thoughtful in him thats what real self sacrificing too for hell have his board to pay at white sands and everybody knows hes got to earn his own way through college so the trustees decided to take you i was tickled to death when thomas came home and told me  i dont feel that i ought to take it murmured anne i mean i dont think i ought to let gilbert make such a sacrifice for for me  i guess you cant prevent him now hes signed papers with the white sands trustees so it wouldnt do him any good now if you were to refuse of course youll take the school youll get along all right now that there are no pyes going josie was the last of them and a good thing she was thats what theres been some pye or other going to avonlea school for the last twenty years and i guess their mission in life was to keep school teachers reminded that earth isnt their home bless my heart what does all that winking and blinking at the barry gable mean  diana is signaling for me to go over laughed anne you know we keep up the old custom excuse me while i run over and see what she wants  anne ran down the clover slope like a deer and disappeared in the firry shadows of the haunted wood mrs lynde looked after her indulgently  theres a good deal of the child about her yet in some ways  theres a good deal more of the woman about her in others retorted marilla with a momentary return of her old crispness  but crispness was no longer marillas distinguishing characteristic as mrs lynde told her thomas that night  marilla cuthbert has got mellow thats what  anne went to the little avonlea graveyard the next evening to put fresh flowers on matthews grave and water the scotch rosebush she lingered there until dusk liking the peace and calm of the little place with its poplars whose rustle was like low friendly speech and its whispering grasses growing at will among the graves when she finally left it and walked down the long hill that sloped to the lake of shining waters it was past sunset and all avonlea lay before her in a dreamlike afterlight a haunt of ancient peace there was a freshness in the air as of a wind that had blown over honey sweet fields of clover home lights twinkled out here and there among the homestead trees beyond lay the sea misty and purple with its haunting unceasing murmur the west was a glory of soft mingled hues and the pond reflected them all in still softer shadings the beauty of it all thrilled annes heart and she gratefully opened the gates of her soul to it  dear old world she murmured you are very lovely and i am glad to be alive in you  halfway down the hill a tall lad came whistling out of a gate before the blythe homestead it was gilbert and the whistle died on his lips as he recognized anne he lifted his cap courteously but he would have passed on in silence if anne had not stopped and held out her hand  gilbert she said with scarlet cheeks i want to thank you for giving up the school for me it was very good of you and i want you to know that i appreciate it  gilbert took the offered hand eagerly  it wasnt particularly good of me at all anne i was pleased to be able to do you some small service are we going to be friends after this have you really forgiven me my old fault  anne laughed and tried unsuccessfully to withdraw her hand  i forgave you that day by the pond landing although i didnt know it what a stubborn little goose i was ive been i may as well make a complete confession ive been sorry ever since  we are going to be the best of friends said gilbert jubilantly we were born to be good friends anne youve thwarted destiny enough i know we can help each other in many ways you are going to keep up your studies arent you so am i come im going to walk home with you  marilla looked curiously at anne when the latter entered the kitchen  who was that came up the lane with you anne  gilbert blythe answered anne vexed to find herself blushing i met him on barrys hill  i didnt think you and gilbert blythe were such good friends that youd stand for half an hour at the gate talking to him said marilla with a dry smile  we havent been weve been good enemies but we have decided that it will be much more sensible to be good friends in the future were we really there half an hour it seemed just a few minutes but you see we have five years lost conversations to catch up with marilla  anne sat long at her window that night companioned by a glad content the wind purred softly in the cherry boughs and the mint breaths came up to her the stars twinkled over the pointed firs in the hollow and dianas light gleamed through the old gap  annes horizons had closed in since the night she had sat there after coming home from queens but if the path set before her feet was to be narrow she knew that flowers of quiet happiness would bloom along it the joy of sincere work and worthy aspiration and congenial friendship were to be hers nothing could rob her of her birthright of fancy or her ideal world of dreams and there was always the bend in the road  ‘gods in his heaven alls right with the world whispered anne softly"@"anne of green gables"@"lucy maud montgomery"
"it was a clear apple green evening in may and four winds harbour was mirroring back the clouds of the golden west between its softly dark shores the sea moaned eerily on the sand bar sorrowful even in spring but a sly jovial wind came piping down the red harbour road along which miss cornelias comfortable matronly figure was making its way towards the village of glen st mary miss cornelia was rightfully mrs marshall elliott and had been mrs marshall elliott for thirteen years but even yet more people referred to her as miss cornelia than as mrs elliott the old name was dear to her old friends only one of them contemptuously dropped it susan baker the gray and grim and faithful handmaiden of the blythe family at ingleside never lost an opportunity of calling her mrs marshall elliott with the most killing and pointed emphasis as if to say you wanted to be mrs and mrs you shall be with a vengeance as far as i am concerned  miss cornelia was going up to ingleside to see dr and mrs blythe who were just home from europe they had been away for three months having left in february to attend a famous medical congress in london and certain things which miss cornelia was anxious to discuss had taken place in the glen during their absence for one thing there was a new family in the manse and such a family miss cornelia shook her head over them several times as she walked briskly along  susan baker and the anne shirley of other days saw her coming as they sat on the big veranda at ingleside enjoying the charm of the cats light the sweetness of sleepy robins whistling among the twilit maples and the dance of a gusty group of daffodils blowing against the old mellow red brick wall of the lawn  anne was sitting on the steps her hands clasped over her knee looking in the kind dusk as girlish as a mother of many has any right to be and the beautiful gray green eyes gazing down the harbour road were as full of unquenchable sparkle and dream as ever behind her in the hammock rilla blythe was curled up a fat roly poly little creature of six years the youngest of the ingleside children she had curly red hair and hazel eyes that were now buttoned up after the funny wrinkled fashion in which rilla always went to sleep  shirley the little brown boy as he was known in the family whos who was asleep in susans arms he was brown haired brown eyed and brown skinned with very rosy cheeks and he was susans especial love after his birth anne had been very ill for a long time and susan mothered the baby with a passionate tenderness which none of the other children dear as they were to her had ever called out dr blythe had said that but for her he would never have lived  i gave him life just as much as you did mrs dr dear susan was wont to say he is just as much my baby as he is yours and indeed it was always to susan that shirley ran to be kissed for bumps and rocked to sleep and protected from well deserved spankings susan had conscientiously spanked all the other blythe children when she thought they needed it for their souls good but she would not spank shirley nor allow his mother to do it once dr blythe had spanked him and susan had been stormily indignant  that man would spank an angel mrs dr dear that he would she had declared bitterly and she would not make the poor doctor a pie for weeks  she had taken shirley with her to her brothers home during his parents absence while all the other children had gone to avonlea and she had three blessed months of him all to herself nevertheless susan was very glad to find herself back at ingleside with all her darlings around her again ingleside was her world and in it she reigned supreme even anne seldom questioned her decisions much to the disgust of mrs rachel lynde of green gables who gloomily told anne whenever she visited four winds that she was letting susan get to be entirely too much of a boss and would live to rue it  here is cornelia bryant coming up the harbour road mrs dr dear said susan she will be coming up to unload three months gossip on us  i hope so said anne hugging her knees im starving for glen st mary gossip susan i hope miss cornelia can tell me everything that has happened while weve been away everything who has got born or married or drunk who has died or gone away or come or fought or lost a cow or found a beau its so delightful to be home again with all the dear glen folks and i want to know all about them why i remember wondering as i walked through westminster abbey which of her two especial beaux millicent drew would finally marry do you know susan i have a dreadful suspicion that i love gossip  well of course mrs dr dear admitted susan every proper woman likes to hear the news i am rather interested in millicent drews case myself i never had a beau much less two and i do not mind now for being an old maid does not hurt when you get used to it millicents hair always looks to me as if she had swept it up with a broom but the men do not seem to mind that  they see only her pretty piquant mocking little face susan  that may very well be mrs dr dear the good book says that favour is deceitful and beauty is vain but i should not have minded finding that out for myself if it had been so ordained i have no doubt we will all be beautiful when we are angels but what good will it do us then speaking of gossip however they do say that poor mrs harrison miller over harbour tried to hang herself last week  oh susan  calm yourself mrs dr dear she did not succeed but i really do not blame her for trying for her husband is a terrible man but she was very foolish to think of hanging herself and leaving the way clear for him to marry some other woman if i had been in her shoes mrs dr dear i would have gone to work to worry him so that he would try to hang himself instead of me not that i hold with people hanging themselves under any circumstances mrs dr dear  what is the matter with harrison miller anyway said anne impatiently he is always driving some one to extremes  well some people call it religion and some call it cussedness begging your pardon mrs dr dear for using such a word it seems they cannot make out which it is in harrisons case there are days when he growls at everybody because he thinks he is fore ordained to eternal punishment and then there are days when he says he does not care and goes and gets drunk my own opinion is that he is not sound in his intellect for none of that branch of the millers were his grandfather went out of his mind he thought he was surrounded by big black spiders they crawled over him and floated in the air about him i hope i shall never go insane mrs dr dear and i do not think i will because it is not a habit of the bakers but if an all wise providence should decree it i hope it will not take the form of big black spiders for i loathe the animals as for mrs miller i do not know whether she really deserves pity or not there are some who say she just married harrison to spite richard taylor which seems to me a very peculiar reason for getting married but then of course i am no judge of things matrimonial mrs dr dear and there is cornelia bryant at the gate so i will put this blessed brown baby on his bed and get my knitting     chapter ii sheer gossip   where are the other children asked miss cornelia when the first greetings cordial on her side rapturous on annes and dignified on susans were over  shirley is in bed and jem and walter and the twins are down in their beloved rainbow valley said anne they just came home this afternoon you know and they could hardly wait until supper was over before rushing down to the valley they love it above every spot on earth even the maple grove doesnt rival it in their affections  i am afraid they love it too well said susan gloomily little jem said once he would rather go to rainbow valley than to heaven when he died and that was not a proper remark  i suppose they had a great time in avonlea said miss cornelia  enormous marilla does spoil them terribly jem in particular can do no wrong in her eyes  miss cuthbert must be an old lady now said miss cornelia getting out her knitting so that she could hold her own with susan miss cornelia held that the woman whose hands were employed always had the advantage over the woman whose hands were not  marilla is eighty five said anne with a sigh her hair is snow white but strange to say her eyesight is better than it was when she was sixty  well dearie im real glad youre all back ive been dreadful lonesome but we havent been dull in the glen believe me there hasnt been such an exciting spring in my time as far as church matters go weve got settled with a minister at last anne dearie  the reverend john knox meredith mrs dr dear said susan resolved not to let miss cornelia tell all the news  is he nice asked anne interestedly  miss cornelia sighed and susan groaned  yes hes nice enough if that were all said the former he is very nice and very learned and very spiritual but oh anne dearie he has no common sense  how was it you called him then  well theres no doubt he is by far the best preacher we ever had in glen st mary church said miss cornelia veering a tack or two i suppose it is because he is so moony and absent minded that he never got a town call his trial sermon was simply wonderful believe me every one went mad about it and his looks  he is very comely mrs dr dear and when all is said and done i do like to see a well looking man in the pulpit broke in susan thinking it was time she asserted herself again  besides said miss cornelia we were anxious to get settled and mr meredith was the first candidate we were all agreed on somebody had some objection to all the others there was some talk of calling mr folsom he was a good preacher too but somehow people didnt care for his appearance he was too dark and sleek  he looked exactly like a great black tomcat that he did mrs dr dear said susan i never could abide such a man in the pulpit every sunday  then mr rogers came and he was like a chip in porridge neither harm nor good resumed miss cornelia but if he had preached like peter and paul it would have profited him nothing for that was the day old caleb ramsays sheep strayed into church and gave a loud ‘ba a a just as he announced his text everybody laughed and poor rogers had no chance after that some thought we ought to call mr stewart because he was so well educated he could read the new testament in five languages  but i do not think he was any surer than other men of getting to heaven because of that interjected susan  most of us didnt like his delivery said miss cornelia ignoring susan he talked in grunts so to speak and mr arnett couldnt preach at all and he picked about the worst candidating text there is in the bible ‘curse ye meroz  whenever he got stuck for an idea he would bang the bible and shout very bitterly ‘curse ye meroz poor meroz got thoroughly cursed that day whoever he was mrs dr dear said susan  the minister who is candidating cant be too careful what text he chooses said miss cornelia solemnly i believe mr pierson would have got the call if he had picked a different text but when he announced ‘i will lift my eyes to the hills he was done for every one grinned for every one knew that those two hill girls from the harbour head have been setting their caps for every single minister who came to the glen for the last fifteen years and mr newman had too large a family  he stayed with my brother in law james clow said susan ‘how many children have you got i asked him ‘nine boys and a sister for each of them he said ‘eighteen said i ‘dear me what a family and then he laughed and laughed but i do not know why mrs dr dear and i am certain that eighteen children would be too many for any manse  he had only ten children susan explained miss cornelia with contemptuous patience and ten good children would not be much worse for the manse and congregation than the four who are there now though i wouldnt say anne dearie that they are so bad either i like them everybody likes them its impossible to help liking them they would be real nice little souls if there was anyone to look after their manners and teach them what is right and proper for instance at school the teacher says they are model children but at home they simply run wild  what about mrs meredith asked anne  theres no mrs meredith that is just the trouble mr meredith is a widower his wife died four years ago if we had known that i dont suppose we would have called him for a widower is even worse in a congregation than a single man but he was heard to speak of his children and we all supposed there was a mother too and when they came there was nobody but old aunt martha as they call her shes a cousin of mr merediths mother i believe and he took her in to save her from the poorhouse she is seventy five years old half blind and very deaf and very cranky  and a very poor cook mrs dr dear  the worst possible manager for a manse said miss cornelia bitterly mr meredith wont get any other housekeeper because he says it would hurt aunt marthas feelings anne dearie believe me the state of that manse is something terrible everything is thick with dust and nothing is ever in its place and we had painted and papered it all so nice before they came  there are four children you say asked anne beginning to mother them already in her heart  yes they run up just like the steps of a stair geralds the oldest hes twelve and they call him jerry hes a clever boy faith is eleven she is a regular tomboy but pretty as a picture i must say  she looks like an angel but she is a holy terror for mischief mrs dr dear said susan solemnly i was at the manse one night last week and mrs james millison was there too she had brought them up a dozen eggs and a little pail of milk a very little pail mrs dr dear faith took them and whisked down the cellar with them near the bottom of the stairs she caught her toe and fell the rest of the way milk and eggs and all you can imagine the result mrs dr dear but that child came up laughing ‘i dont know whether im myself or a custard pie she said and mrs james millison was very angry she said she would never take another thing to the manse if it was to be wasted and destroyed in that fashion  maria millison never hurt herself taking things to the manse sniffed miss cornelia she just took them that night as an excuse for curiosity but poor faith is always getting into scrapes she is so heedless and impulsive  just like me im going to like your faith said anne decidedly  she is full of spunk and i do like spunk mrs dr dear admitted susan  theres something taking about her conceded miss cornelia you never see her but shes laughing and somehow it always makes you want to laugh too she cant even keep a straight face in church una is ten shes a sweet little thing not pretty but sweet and thomas carlyle is nine they call him carl and he has a regular mania for collecting toads and bugs and frogs and bringing them into the house  i suppose he was responsible for the dead rat that was lying on a chair in the parlour the afternoon mrs grant called it gave her a turn said susan and i do not wonder for manse parlours are no places for dead rats to be sure it may have been the cat who left it there he is as full of the old nick as he can be stuffed mrs dr dear a manse cat should at least look respectable in my opinion whatever he really is but i never saw such a rakish looking beast and he walks along the ridgepole of the manse almost every evening at sunset mrs dr dear and waves his tail and that is not becoming  the worst of it is they are never decently dressed sighed miss cornelia and since the snow went they go to school barefooted now you know anne dearie that isnt the right thing for manse children especially when the methodist ministers little girl always wears such nice buttoned boots and i do wish they wouldnt play in the old methodist graveyard  its very tempting when its right beside the manse said anne ive always thought graveyards must be delightful places to play in  oh no you did not mrs dr dear said loyal susan determined to protect anne from herself you have too much good sense and decorum  why did they ever build that manse beside the graveyard in the first place asked anne their lawn is so small there is no place for them to play except in the graveyard  it was a mistake admitted miss cornelia but they got the lot cheap and no other manse children ever thought of playing there mr meredith shouldnt allow it but he has always got his nose buried in a book when he is home he reads and reads or walks about in his study in a day dream so far he hasnt forgotten to be in church on sundays but twice he has forgotten about the prayer meeting and one of the elders had to go over to the manse and remind him and he forgot about fanny coopers wedding they rang him up on the ‘phone and then he rushed right over just as he was carpet slippers and all one wouldnt mind if the methodists didnt laugh so about it but theres one comfort they cant criticize his sermons he wakes up when hes in the pulpit believe me and the methodist minister cant preach at all so they tell me i have never heard him thank goodness  miss cornelias scorn of men had abated somewhat since her marriage but her scorn of methodists remained untinged of charity susan smiled slyly  they do say mrs marshall elliott that the methodists and presbyterians are talking of uniting she said  well all i hope is that ill be under the sod if that ever comes to pass retorted miss cornelia i shall never have truck or trade with methodists and mr meredith will find that hed better steer clear of them too he is entirely too sociable with them believe me why he went to the jacob drews silver wedding supper and got into a nice scrape as a result  what was it  mrs drew asked him to carve the roast goose for jacob drew never did or could carve well mr meredith tackled it and in the process he knocked it clean off the platter into mrs reeses lap who was sitting next him and he just said dreamily ‘mrs reese will you kindly return me that goose mrs reese ‘returned it as meek as moses but she must have been furious for she had on her new silk dress the worst of it is she was a methodist  but i think that is better than if she was a presbyterian interjected susan if she had been a presbyterian she would mostly likely have left the church and we cannot afford to lose our members and mrs reese is not liked in her own church because she gives herself such great airs so that the methodists would be rather pleased that mr meredith spoiled her dress  the point is he made himself ridiculous and i for one do not like to see my minister made ridiculous in the eyes of the methodists said miss cornelia stiffly if he had had a wife it would not have happened  i do not see if he had a dozen wives how they could have prevented mrs drew from using up her tough old gander for the wedding feast said susan stubbornly  they say that was her husbands doing said miss cornelia jacob drew is a conceited stingy domineering creature  and they do say he and his wife detest each other which does not seem to me the proper way for married folks to get along but then of course i have had no experience along that line said susan tossing her head and i am not one to blame everything on the men mrs drew is mean enough herself they say that the only thing she was ever known to give away was a crock of butter made out of cream a rat had fell into she contributed it to a church social nobody found out about the rat until afterwards  fortunately all the people the merediths have offended so far are methodists said miss cornelia that jerry went to the methodist prayer meeting one night about a fortnight ago and sat beside old william marsh who got up as usual and testified with fearful groans ‘do you feel any better now whispered jerry when william sat down poor jerry meant to be sympathetic but mr marsh thought he was impertinent and is furious at him of course jerry had no business to be in a methodist prayer meeting at all but they go where they like  i hope they will not offend mrs alec davis of the harbour head said susan she is a very touchy woman i understand but she is very well off and pays the most of any one to the salary i have heard that she says the merediths are the worst brought up children she ever saw  every word you say convinces me more and more that the merediths belong to the race that knows joseph said mistress anne decidedly  when all is said and done they do admitted miss cornelia and that balances everything anyway weve got them now and we must just do the best we can by them and stick up for them to the methodists well i suppose i must be getting down harbour marshall will soon be home he went over harbour to day and wanting his super man like im sorry i havent seen the other children and wheres the doctor  up at the harbour head weve only been home three days and in that time he has spent three hours in his own bed and eaten two meals in his own house  well everybody who has been sick for the last six weeks has been waiting for him to come home and i dont blame them when that over harbour doctor married the undertakers daughter at lowbridge people felt suspicious of him it didnt look well you and the doctor must come down soon and tell us all about your trip i suppose youve had a splendid time  we had agreed anne it was the fulfilment of years of dreams the old world is very lovely and very wonderful but we have come back very well satisfied with our own land canada is the finest country in the world miss cornelia  nobody ever doubted that said miss cornelia complacently  and old pei is the loveliest province in it and four winds the loveliest spot in pei laughed anne looking adoringly out over the sunset splendour of glen and harbour and gulf she waved her hand at it i saw nothing more beautiful than that in europe miss cornelia must you go the children will be sorry to have missed you  they must come and see me soon tell them the doughnut jar is always full  oh at supper they were planning a descent on you theyll go soon but they must settle down to school again now and the twins are going to take music lessons  not from the methodist ministers wife i hope said miss cornelia anxiously  no from rosemary west i was up last evening to arrange it with her what a pretty girl she is  rosemary holds her own well she isnt as young as she once was  i thought her very charming ive never had any real acquaintance with her you know their house is so out of the way and ive seldom ever seen her except at church  people always have liked rosemary west though they dont understand her said miss cornelia quite unconscious of the high tribute she was paying to rosemarys charm ellen has always kept her down so to speak she has tyrannized over her and yet she has always indulged her in a good many ways rosemary was engaged once you know to young martin crawford his ship was wrecked on the magdalens and all the crew were drowned rosemary was just a child only seventeen but she was never the same afterwards she and ellen have stayed very close at home since their mothers death they dont often get to their own church at lowbridge and i understand ellen doesnt approve of going too often to a presbyterian church to the methodist she never goes ill say that much for her that family of wests have always been strong episcopalians rosemary and ellen are pretty well off rosemary doesnt really need to give music lessons she does it because she likes to they are distantly related to leslie you know are the fords coming to the harbour this summer  no they are going on a trip to japan and will probably be away for a year owens new novel is to have a japanese setting this will be the first summer that the dear old house of dreams will be empty since we left it  i should think owen ford might find enough to write about in canada without dragging his wife and his innocent children off to a heathen country like japan grumbled miss cornelia the life book was the best book hes ever written and he got the material for that right here in four winds  captain jim gave him the most of that you know and he collected it all over the world but owens books are all delightful i think  oh theyre well enough as far as they go i make it a point to read every one he writes though ive always held anne dearie that reading novels is a sinful waste of time i shall write and tell him my opinion of this japanese business believe me does he want kenneth and persis to be converted into pagans  with which unanswerable conundrum miss cornelia took her departure susan proceeded to put rilla in bed and anne sat on the veranda steps under the early stars and dreamed her incorrigible dreams and learned all over again for the hundredth happy time what a moonrise splendour and sheen could be on four winds harbour     chapter iii the ingleside children   in daytime the blythe children liked very well to play in the rich soft greens and glooms of the big maple grove between ingleside and the glen st mary pond but for evening revels there was no place like the little valley behind the maple grove it was a fairy realm of romance to them once looking from the attic windows of ingleside through the mist and aftermath of a summer thunderstorm they had seen the beloved spot arched by a glorious rainbow one end of which seemed to dip straight down to where a corner of the pond ran up into the lower end of the valley  let us call it rainbow valley said walter delightedly and rainbow valley thenceforth it was  outside of rainbow valley the wind might be rollicking and boisterous here it always went gently little winding fairy paths ran here and there over spruce roots cushioned with moss wild cherry trees that in blossom time would be misty white were scattered all over the valley mingling with the dark spruces a little brook with amber waters ran through it from the glen village the houses of the village were comfortably far away only at the upper end of the valley was a little tumble down deserted cottage referred to as the old bailey house it had not been occupied for many years but a grass grown dyke surrounded it and inside was an ancient garden where the ingleside children could find violets and daisies and june lilies still blooming in season for the rest the garden was overgrown with caraway that swayed and foamed in the moonshine of summer eves like seas of silver  to the sought lay the pond and beyond it the ripened distance lost itself in purple woods save where on a high hill a solitary old gray homestead looked down on glen and harbour there was a certain wild woodsiness and solitude about rainbow valley in spite of its nearness to the village which endeared it to the children of ingleside  the valley was full of dear friendly hollows and the largest of these was their favourite stamping ground here they were assembled on this particular evening there was a grove of young spruces in this hollow with a tiny grassy glade in its heart opening on the bank of the brook by the brook grew a silver birch tree a young incredibly straight thing which walter had named the white lady in this glade too were the tree lovers as walter called a spruce and maple which grew so closely together that their boughs were inextricably intertwined jem had hung an old string of sleigh bells given him by the glen blacksmith on the tree lovers and every visitant breeze called out sudden fairy tinkles from it  how nice it is to be back said nan after all none of the avonlea places are quite as nice as rainbow valley  but they were very fond of the avonlea places for all that a visit to green gables was always considered a great treat aunt marilla was very good to them and so was mrs rachel lynde who was spending the leisure of her old age in knitting cotton warp quilts against the day when annes daughters should need a setting out there were jolly playmates there too uncle davys children and aunt dianas children they knew all the spots their mother had loved so well in her girlhood at old green gables the long lovers lane that was pink hedged in wild rose time the always neat yard with its willows and poplars the dryads bubble lucent and lovely as of yore the lake of shining waters and willowmere the twins had their mothers old porch gable room and aunt marilla used to come in at night when she thought they were asleep to gloat over them but they all knew she loved jem the best  jem was at present busily occupied in frying a mess of small trout which he had just caught in the pond his stove consisted of a circle of red stones with a fire kindled in it and his culinary utensils were an old tin can hammered out flat and a fork with only one tine left nevertheless ripping good meals had before now been thus prepared  jem was the child of the house of dreams all the others had been born at ingleside he had curly red hair like his mothers and frank hazel eyes like his fathers he had his mothers fine nose and his fathers steady humorous mouth and he was the only one of the family who had ears nice enough to please susan but he had a standing feud with susan because she would not give up calling him little jem it was outrageous thought thirteen year old jem mother had more sense  im not little any more mother he had cried indignantly on his eighth birthday im awful big  mother had sighed and laughed and sighed again and she never called him little jem again in his hearing at least  he was and always had been a sturdy reliable little chap he never broke a promise he was not a great talker his teachers did not think him brilliant but he was a good all round student he never took things on faith he always liked to investigate the truth of a statement for himself once susan had told him that if he touched his tongue to a frosty latch all the skin would tear off it jem had promptly done it just to see if it was so he found it was so at the cost of a very sore tongue for several days but jem did not grudge suffering in the interests of science by constant experiment and observation he learned a great deal and his brothers and sisters thought his extensive knowledge of their little world quite wonderful jem always knew where the first and ripest berries grew where the first pale violets shyly wakened from their winters sleep and how many blue eggs were in a given robins nest in the maple grove he could tell fortunes from daisy petals and suck honey from red clovers and grub up all sorts of edible roots on the banks of the pond while susan went in daily fear that they would all be poisoned he knew where the finest spruce gum was to be found in pale amber knots on the lichened bark he knew where the nuts grew thickest in the beechwoods around the harbour head and where the best trouting places up the brooks were he could mimic the call of any wild bird or beast in four winds and he knew the haunt of every wild flower from spring to autumn  walter blythe was sitting under the white lady with a volume of poems lying beside him but he was not reading he was gazing now at the emerald misted willows by the pond and now at a flock of clouds like little silver sheep herded by the wind that were drifting over rainbow valley with rapture in his wide splendid eyes walters eyes were very wonderful all the joy and sorrow and laughter and loyalty and aspiration of many generations lying under the sod looked out of their dark gray depths  walter was a hop out of kin as far as looks went he did not resemble any known relative he was quite the handsomest of the ingleside children with straight black hair and finely modelled features but he had all his mothers vivid imagination and passionate love of beauty frost of winter invitation of spring dream of summer and glamour of autumn all meant much to walter  in school where jem was a chieftain walter was not thought highly of he was supposed to be girly and milk soppish because he never fought and seldom joined in the school sports preferring to herd by himself in out of the way corners and read books especially potry books walter loved the poets and pored over their pages from the time he could first read their music was woven into his growing soul the music of the immortals walter cherished the ambition to be a poet himself some day the thing could be done a certain uncle paul so called out of courtesy who lived now in that mysterious realm called the states was walters model uncle paul had once been a little school boy in avonlea and now his poetry was read everywhere but the glen schoolboys did not know of walters dreams and would not have been greatly impressed if they had in spite of his lack of physical prowess however he commanded a certain unwilling respect because of his power of talking book talk nobody in glen st mary school could talk like him he sounded like a preacher one boy said and for this reason he was generally left alone and not persecuted as most boys were who were suspected of disliking or fearing fisticuffs  the ten year old ingleside twins violated twin tradition by not looking in the least alike anne who was always called nan was very pretty with velvety nut brown eyes and silky nut brown hair she was a very blithe and dainty little maiden blythe by name and blithe by nature one of her teachers had said her complexion was quite faultless much to her mothers satisfaction  im so glad i have one daughter who can wear pink mrs blythe was wont to say jubilantly  diana blythe known as di was very like her mother with gray green eyes that always shone with a peculiar lustre and brilliancy in the dusk and red hair perhaps this was why she was her fathers favourite she and walter were especial chums di was the only one to whom he would ever read the verses he wrote himself the only one who knew that he was secretly hard at work on an epic strikingly resembling marmion in some things if not in others she kept all his secrets even from nan and told him all hers  wont you soon have those fish ready jem said nan sniffing with her dainty nose the smell makes me awfully hungry  theyre nearly ready said jem giving one a dexterous turn get out the bread and the plates girls walter wake up  how the air shines to night said walter dreamily not that he despised fried trout either by any means but with walter food for the soul always took first place the flower angel has been walking over the world to day calling to the flowers i can see his blue wings on that hill by the woods  any angels wings i ever saw were white said nan  the flower angels arent they are a pale misty blue just like the haze in the valley oh how i wish i could fly it must be glorious  one does fly in dreams sometimes said di  i never dream that im flying exactly said walter but i often dream that i just rise up from the ground and float over the fences and the trees its delightful and i always think ‘this isnt a dream like its always been before this is real and then i wake up after all and its heart breaking  hurry up nan ordered jem  nan had produced the banquet board a board literally as well as figuratively from which many a feast seasoned as no viands were elsewhere had been eaten in rainbow valley it was converted into a table by propping it on two large mossy stones newspapers served as tablecloth and broken plates and handleless cups from susans discard furnished the dishes from a tin box secreted at the root of a spruce tree nan brought forth bread and salt the brook gave adams ale of unsurpassed crystal for the rest there was a certain sauce compounded of fresh air and appetite of youth which gave to everything a divine flavour to sit in rainbow valley steeped in a twilight half gold half amethyst rife with the odours of balsam fir and woodsy growing things in their springtime prime with the pale stars of wild strawberry blossoms all around you and with the sough of the wind and tinkle of bells in the shaking tree tops and eat fried trout and dry bread was something which the mighty of earth might have envied them  sit in invited nan as jem placed his sizzling tin platter of trout on the table its your turn to say grace jem  ive done my part frying the trout protested jem who hated saying grace let walter say it he likes saying grace and cut it short too walt im starving  but walter said no grace short or long just then an interruption occurred  whos coming down from the manse hill said di     chapter iv the manse children   aunt martha might be and was a very poor housekeeper the rev john knox meredith might be and was a very absent minded indulgent man but it could not be denied that there was something very homelike and lovable about the glen st mary manse in spite of its untidiness even the critical housewives of the glen felt it and were unconsciously mellowed in judgment because of it perhaps its charm was in part due to accidental circumstances the luxuriant vines clustering over its gray clap boarded walls the friendly acacias and balm of gileads that crowded about it with the freedom of old acquaintance and the beautiful views of harbour and sand dunes from its front windows but these things had been there in the reign of mr merediths predecessor when the manse had been the primmest neatest and dreariest house in the glen so much of the credit must be given to the personality of its new inmates there was an atmosphere of laughter and comradeship about it the doors were always open and inner and outer worlds joined hands love was the only law in glen st mary manse  the people of his congregation said that mr meredith spoiled his children very likely he did it is certain that he could not bear to scold them they have no mother he used to say to himself with a sigh when some unusually glaring peccadillo forced itself upon his notice but he did not know the half of their goings on he belonged to the sect of dreamers the windows of his study looked out on the graveyard but as he paced up and down the room reflecting deeply on the immortality of the soul he was quite unaware that jerry and carl were playing leap frog hilariously over the flat stones in that abode of dead methodists mr meredith had occasional acute realizations that his children were not so well looked after physically or morally as they had been before his wife died and he had always a dim sub consciousness that house and meals were very different under aunt marthas management from what they had been under cecilias for the rest he lived in a world of books and abstractions and therefore although his clothes were seldom brushed and although the glen housewives concluded from the ivory like pallor of his clear cut features and slender hands that he never got enough to eat he was not an unhappy man  if ever a graveyard could be called a cheerful place the old methodist graveyard at glen st mary might be so called the new graveyard at the other side of the methodist church was a neat and proper and doleful spot but the old one had been left so long to natures kindly and gracious ministries that it had become very pleasant  it was surrounded on three sides by a dyke of stones and sod topped by a gray and uncertain paling outside the dyke grew a row of tall fir trees with thick balsamic boughs the dyke which had been built by the first settlers of the glen was old enough to be beautiful with mosses and green things growing out of its crevices violets purpling at its base in the early spring days and asters and golden rod making an autumnal glory in its corners little ferns clustered companionably between its stones and here and there a big bracken grew  on the eastern side there was neither fence nor dyke the graveyard there straggled off into a young fir plantation ever pushing nearer to the graves and deepening eastward into a thick wood the air was always full of the harp like voices of the sea and the music of gray old trees and in the spring mornings the choruses of birds in the elms around the two churches sang of life and not of death the meredith children loved the old graveyard  blue eyed ivy garden spruce and mint ran riot over the sunken graves blueberry bushes grew lavishly in the sandy corner next to the fir wood the varying fashions of tombstones for three generations were to be found there from the flat oblong red sandstone slabs of old settlers down through the days of weeping willows and clasped hands to the latest monstrosities of tall monuments and draped urns one of the latter the biggest and ugliest in the graveyard was sacred to the memory of a certain alec davis who had been born a methodist but had taken to himself a presbyterian bride of the douglas clan she had made him turn presbyterian and kept him toeing the presbyterian mark all his life but when he died she did not dare to doom him to a lonely grave in the presbyterian graveyard over harbour his people were all buried in the methodist cemetery so alec davis went back to his own in death and his widow consoled herself by erecting a monument which cost more than any of the methodists could afford the meredith children hated it without just knowing why but they loved the old flat bench like stones with the tall grasses growing rankly about them they made jolly seats for one thing they were all sitting on one now jerry tired of leap frog was playing on a jews harp carl was lovingly poring over a strange beetle he had found una was trying to make a dolls dress and faith leaning back on her slender brown wrists was swinging her bare feet in lively time to the jews harp  jerry had his fathers black hair and large black eyes but in him the latter were flashing instead of dreamy faith who came next to him wore her beauty like a rose careless and glowing she had golden brown eyes golden brown curls and crimson cheeks she laughed too much to please her fathers congregation and had shocked old mrs taylor the disconsolate spouse of several departed husbands by saucily declaring in the church porch at that the world isnt a vale of tears mrs taylor its a world of laughter  little dreamy una was not given to laughter her braids of straight dead black hair betrayed no lawless kinks and her almond shaped dark blue eyes had something wistful and sorrowful in them her mouth had a trick of falling open over her tiny white teeth and a shy meditative smile occasionally crept over her small face she was much more sensitive to public opinion than faith and had an uneasy consciousness that there was something askew in their way of living she longed to put it right but did not know how now and then she dusted the furniture but it was so seldom she could find the duster because it was never in the same place twice and when the clothes brush was to be found she tried to brush her fathers best suit on saturdays and once sewed on a missing button with coarse white thread when mr meredith went to church next day every female eye saw that button and the peace of the ladies aid was upset for weeks  carl had the clear bright dark blue eyes fearless and direct of his dead mother and her brown hair with its glints of gold he knew the secrets of bugs and had a sort of freemasonry with bees and beetles una never liked to sit near him because she never knew what uncanny creature might be secreted about him jerry refused to sleep with him because carl had once taken a young garter snake to bed with him so carl slept in his old cot which was so short that he could never stretch out and had strange bed fellows perhaps it was just as well that aunt martha was half blind when she made that bed altogether they were a jolly lovable little crew and cecilia merediths heart must have ached bitterly when she faced the knowledge that she must leave them  where would you like to be buried if you were a methodist asked faith cheerfully  this opened up an interesting field of speculation  there isnt much choice the place is full said jerry id like that corner near the road i guess i could hear the teams going past and the people talking  id like that little hollow under the weeping birch said una that birch is such a place for birds and they sing like mad in the mornings  id take the porter lot where theres so many children buried i like lots of company said faith carl whered you  id rather not be buried at all said carl but if i had to be id like the ant bed ants are awfly intresting  how very good all the people who are buried here must have been said una who had been reading the laudatory old epitaphs there doesnt seem to be a single bad person in the whole graveyard methodists must be better than presbyterians after all  maybe the methodists bury their bad people just like they do cats suggested carl maybe they dont bother bringing them to the graveyard at all  nonsense said faith the people that are buried here werent any better than other folks una but when anyone is dead you mustnt say anything of him but good or hell come back and hant you aunt martha told me that i asked father if it was true and he just looked through me and muttered ‘true true what is truth what is truth o jesting pilate i concluded from that it must be true  i wonder if mr alec davis would come back and hant me if i threw a stone at the urn on top of his tombstone said jerry  mrs davis would giggled faith she just watches us in church like a cat watching mice last sunday i made a face at her nephew and he made one back at me and you should have seen her glare ill bet she boxed his ears when they got out mrs marshall elliott told me we mustnt offend her on any account or id have made a face at her too  they say jem blythe stuck out his tongue at her once and she would never have his father again even when her husband was dying said jerry i wonder what the blythe gang will be like  i liked their looks said faith the manse children had been at the station that afternoon when the blythe small fry had arrived i liked jems looks especially  they say in school that walters a sissy said jerry  i dont believe it said una who had thought walter very handsome  well he writes poetry anyhow he won the prize the teacher offered last year for writing a poem bertie shakespeare drew told me berties mother thought he should have got the prize because of his name but bertie said he couldnt write poetry to save his soul name or no name  i suppose well get acquainted with them as soon as they begin going to school mused faith i hope the girls are nice i dont like most of the girls round here even the nice ones are poky but the blythe twins look jolly i thought twins always looked alike but they dont i think the red haired one is the nicest  i liked their mothers looks said una with a little sigh una envied all children their mothers she had been only six when her mother died but she had some very precious memories treasured in her soul like jewels of twilight cuddlings and morning frolics of loving eyes a tender voice and the sweetest gayest laugh  they say she isnt like other people said jerry  mrs elliot says that is because she never really grew up said faith  shes taller than mrs elliott  yes yes but it is inside mrs elliot says mrs blythe just stayed a little girl inside  what do i smell interrupted carl sniffing  they all smelled it now a most delectable odour came floating up on the still evening air from the direction of the little woodsy dell below the manse hill  that makes me hungry said jerry  we had only bread and molasses for supper and cold ditto for dinner said una plaintively  aunt marthas habit was to boil a large slab of mutton early in the week and serve it up every day cold and greasy as long as it lasted to this faith in a moment of inspiration had give the name of ditto and by this it was invariably known at the manse  lets go and see where that smell is coming from said jerry  they all sprang up frolicked over the lawn with the abandon of young puppies climbed a fence and tore down the mossy slope guided by the savory lure that ever grew stronger a few minutes later they arrived breathlessly in the sanctum sanctorum of rainbow valley where the blythe children were just about to give thanks and eat  they halted shyly una wished they had not been so precipitate  but di blythe was equal to that and any occasion she stepped forward with a comrades smile  i guess i know who you are she said you belong to the manse dont you  faith nodded her face creased by dimples  we smelled your trout cooking and wondered what it was  you must sit down and help us eat them said di  maybe you havent more than you want yourselves said jerry looking hungrily at the tin platter  weve heaps three apiece said jem sit down  no more ceremony was necessary down they all sat on mossy stones merry was that feast and long nan and di would probably have died of horror had they known what faith and una knew perfectly well that carl had two young mice in his jacket pocket but they never knew it so it never hurt them where can folks get better acquainted than over a meal table when the last trout had vanished the manse children and the ingleside children were sworn friends and allies they had always known each other and always would the race of joseph recognized its own  they poured out the history of their little pasts the manse children heard of avonlea and green gables of rainbow valley traditions and of the little house by the harbour shore where jem had been born the ingleside children heard of maywater where the merediths had lived before coming to the glen of unas beloved one eyed doll and faiths pet rooster  faith was inclined to resent the fact that people laughed at her for petting a rooster she liked the blythes because they accepted it without question  a handsome rooster like adam is just as nice a pet as a dog or cat i think she said if he was a canary nobody would wonder and i brought him up from a little wee yellow chicken mrs johnson at maywater gave him to me a weasel had killed all his brothers and sisters i called him after her husband i never liked dolls or cats cats are too sneaky and dolls are dead  who lives in that house away up there asked jerry  the miss wests rosemary and ellen answered nan di and i are going to take music lessons from miss rosemary this summer  una gazed at the lucky twins with eyes whose longing was too gentle for envy oh if she could only have music lessons it was one of the dreams of her little hidden life but nobody ever thought of such a thing  miss rosemary is so sweet and she always dresses so pretty said di her hair is just the colour of new molasses taffy she added wistfully for di like her mother before her was not resigned to her own ruddy tresses  i like miss ellen too said nan she always used to give me candies when she came to church but di is afraid of her  her brows are so black and she has such a great deep voice said di oh how scared of her kenneth ford used to be when he was little mother says the first sunday mrs ford brought him to church miss ellen happened to be there sitting right behind them and the minute kenneth saw her he just screamed and screamed until mrs ford had to carry him out  who is mrs ford asked una wonderingly  oh the fords dont live here they only come here in the summer and theyre not coming this summer they live in that little house ‘way ‘way down on the harbour shore where father and mother used to live i wish you could see persis ford she is just like a picture  ive heard of mrs ford broke in faith bertie shakespeare drew told me about her she was married fourteen years to a dead man and then he came to life  nonsense said nan that isnt the way it goes at all bertie shakespeare can never get anything straight i know the whole story and ill tell it to you some time but not now for its too long and its time for us to go home mother doesnt like us to be out late these damp evenings  nobody cared whether the manse children were out in the damp or not aunt martha was already in bed and the minister was still too deeply lost in speculations concerning the immortality of the soul to remember the mortality of the body but they went home too with visions of good times coming in their heads  i think rainbow valley is even nicer than the graveyard said una and i just love those dear blythes its so nice when you can love people because so often you cant father said in his sermon last sunday that we should love everybody but how can we how could we love mrs alec davis  oh father only said that in the pulpit said faith airily he has more sense than to really think it outside  the blythe children went up to ingleside except jem who slipped away for a few moments on a solitary expedition to a remote corner of rainbow valley mayflowers grew there and jem never forgot to take his mother a bouquet as long as they lasted     chapter v the advent of mary vance   this is just the sort of day you feel as if things might happen said faith responsive to the lure of crystal air and blue hills she hugged herself with delight and danced a hornpipe on old hezekiah pollocks bench tombstone much to the horror of two ancient maidens who happened to be driving past just as faith hopped on one foot around the stone waving the other and her arms in the air  and that groaned one ancient maiden is our ministers daughter  what else could you expect of a widowers family groaned the other ancient maiden and then they both shook their heads  it was early on saturday morning and the merediths were out in the dew drenched world with a delightful consciousness of the holiday they had never had anything to do on a holiday even nan and di blythe had certain household tasks for saturday mornings but the daughters of the manse were free to roam from blushing morn to dewy eve if so it pleased them it did please faith but una felt a secret bitter humiliation because they never learned to do anything the other girls in her class at school could cook and sew and knit she only was a little ignoramus  jerry suggested that they go exploring so they went lingeringly through the fir grove picking up carl on the way who was on his knees in the dripping grass studying his darling ants beyond the grove they came out in mr taylors pasture field sprinkled over with the white ghosts of dandelions in a remote corner was an old tumbledown barn where mr taylor sometimes stored his surplus hay crop but which was never used for any other purpose thither the meredith children trooped and prowled about the ground floor for several minutes  what was that whispered una suddenly  they all listened there was a faint but distinct rustle in the hayloft above the merediths looked at each other  theres something up there breathed faith  im going up to see what it is said jerry resolutely  oh dont begged una catching his arm  im going  well all go too then said faith  the whole four climbed the shaky ladder jerry and faith quite dauntless una pale from fright and carl rather absent mindedly speculating on the possibility of finding a bat up in the loft he longed to see a bat in daylight  when they stepped off the ladder they saw what had made the rustle and the sight struck them dumb for a few moments  in a little nest in the hay a girl was curled up looking as if she had just wakened from sleep when she saw them she stood up rather shakily as it seemed and in the bright sunlight that streamed through the cobwebbed window behind her they saw that her thin sunburned face was very pale under its tan she had two braids of lank thick tow coloured hair and very odd eyes white eyes the manse children thought as she stared at them half defiantly half piteously they were really of so pale a blue that they did seem almost white especially when contrasted with the narrow black ring that circled the iris she was barefooted and bareheaded and was clad in a faded ragged old plaid dress much too short and tight for her as for years she might have been almost any age judging from her wizened little face but her height seemed to be somewhere in the neighbourhood of twelve  who are you asked jerry  the girl looked about her as if seeking a way of escape then she seemed to give in with a little shiver of despair  im mary vance she said  whered you come from pursued jerry  mary instead of replying suddenly sat or fell down on the hay and began to cry instantly faith had flung herself down beside her and put her arm around the thin shaking shoulders  you stop bothering her she commanded jerry then she hugged the waif dont cry dear just tell us whats the matter were friends  im so so hungry wailed mary i i haint had a thing to eat since thursday morning ‘cept a little water from the brook out there  the manse children gazed at each other in horror faith sprang up  you come right up to the manse and get something to eat before you say another word  mary shrank  oh i cant what will your pa and ma say besides theyd send me back  weve no mother and father wont bother about you neither will aunt martha come i say faith stamped her foot impatiently was this queer girl going to insist on starving to death almost at their very door  mary yielded she was so weak that she could hardly climb down the ladder but somehow they got her down and over the field and into the manse kitchen aunt martha muddling through her saturday cooking took no notice of her faith and una flew to the pantry and ransacked it for such eatables as it contained some ditto bread butter milk and a doubtful pie mary vance attacked the food ravenously and uncritically while the manse children stood around and watched her jerry noticed that she had a pretty mouth and very nice even white teeth faith decided with secret horror that mary had not one stitch on her except that ragged faded dress una was full of pure pity carl of amused wonder and all of them of curiosity  now come out to the graveyard and tell us about yourself ordered faith when marys appetite showed signs of failing her mary was now nothing loath food had restored her natural vivacity and unloosed her by no means reluctant tongue  you wont tell your pa or anybody if i tell you she stipulated when she was enthroned on mr pollocks tombstone opposite her the manse children lined up on another here was spice and mystery and adventure something had happened  no we wont  cross your hearts  cross our hearts  well ive run away i was living with mrs wiley over harbour do you know mrs wiley  no  well you dont want to know her shes an awful woman my how i hate her she worked me to death and wouldnt give me half enough to eat and she used to larrup me ‘most every day look a here  mary rolled up her ragged sleeves and held up her scrawny arms and thin hands chapped almost to rawness they were black with bruises the manse children shivered faith flushed crimson with indignation unas blue eyes filled with tears  she licked me wednesday night with a stick said mary indifferently it was ‘cause i let the cow kick over a pail of milk howd i know the darn old cow was going to kick  a not unpleasant thrill ran over her listeners they would never dream of using such dubious words but it was rather titivating to hear someone else use them and a girl at that certainly this mary vance was an interesting creature  i dont blame you for running away said faith  oh i didnt run away ‘cause she licked me a licking was all in the days work with me i was darn well used to it nope id meant to run away for a week ‘cause id found out that mrs wiley was going to rent her farm and go to lowbridge to live and give me to a cousin of hers up charlottetown way i wasnt going to stand for that she was a worse sort than mrs wiley even mrs wiley lent me to her for a month last summer and id rather live with the devil himself  sensation number two but una looked doubtful  so i made up my mind id beat it i had seventy cents saved up that mrs john crawford give me in the spring for planting potatoes for her mrs wiley didnt know about it she was away visiting her cousin when i planted them i thought id sneak up here to the glen and buy a ticket to charlottetown and try to get work there im a hustler let me tell you there aint a lazy bone in my body so i lit out thursday morning ‘fore mrs wiley was up and walked to the glen six miles and when i got to the station i found id lost my money dunno how dunno where anyhow it was gone i didnt know what to do if i went back to old lady wiley shed take the hide off me so i went and hid in that old barn  and what will you do now asked jerry  dunno i spose ill have to go back and take my medicine now that ive got some grub in my stomach i guess i can stand it  but there was fear behind the bravado in marys eyes una suddenly slipped from the one tombstone to the other and put her arm about mary  dont go back just stay here with us  oh mrs wileyll hunt me up said mary its likely shes on my trail before this i might stay here till she finds me i spose if your folks dont mind i was a darn fool ever to think of skipping out shed run a weasel to earth but i was so misrebul  marys voice quivered but she was ashamed of showing her weakness  i haint had the life of a dog for these four years she explained defiantly  youve been four years with mrs wiley  yip she took me out of the asylum over in hopetown when i was eight  thats the same place mrs blythe came from exclaimed faith  i was two years in the asylum i was put there when i was six my ma had hung herself and my pa had cut his throat  holy cats why said jerry  booze said mary laconically  and youve no relations  not a darn one that i know of must have had some once though i was called after half a dozen of them my full name is mary martha lucilla moore ball vance can you beat that my grandfather was a rich man ill bet he was richer than your grandfather but pa drunk it all up and ma she did her part they used to beat me too laws ive been licked so much i kind of like it  mary tossed her head she divined that the manse children were pitying her for her many stripes and she did not want pity she wanted to be envied she looked gaily about her her strange eyes now that the dullness of famine was removed from them were brilliant she would show these youngsters what a personage she was  ive been sick an awful lot she said proudly theres not many kids could have come through what i have ive had scarlet fever and measles and ersipelas and mumps and whooping cough and pewmonia  were you ever fatally sick asked una  i dont know said mary doubtfully  of course she wasnt scoffed jerry if youre fatally sick you die  oh well i never died exactly said mary but i come blamed near it once they thought i was dead and they were getting ready to lay me out when i up and come to  what is it like to be half dead asked jerry curiously  like nothing i didnt know it for days afterwards it was when i had the pewmonia mrs wiley wouldnt have the doctor said she wasnt going to no such expense for a home girl old aunt christina macallister nursed me with poultices she brung me round but sometimes i wish id just died the other half and done with it id been better off  if you went to heaven i spose you would said faith rather doubtfully  well what other place is there to go to demanded mary in a puzzled voice  theres hell you know said una dropping her voice and hugging mary to lessen the awfulness of the suggestion  hell whats that  why its where the devil lives said jerry youve heard of him you spoke about him  oh yes but i didnt know he lived anywhere i thought he just roamed round mr wiley used to mention hell when he was alive he was always telling folks to go there i thought it was some place over in new brunswick where he come from  hell is an awful place said faith with the dramatic enjoyment that is born of telling dreadful things bad people go there when they die and burn in fire for ever and ever and ever  who told you that demanded mary incredulously  its in the bible and mr isaac crothers at maywater told us too in sunday school he was an elder and a pillar in the church and knew all about it but you neednt worry if youre good youll go to heaven and if youre bad i guess youd rather go to hell  i wouldnt said mary positively no matter how bad i was i wouldnt want to be burned and burned i know what its like i picked up a red hot poker once by accident what must you do to be good  you must go to church and sunday school and read your bible and pray every night and give to missions said una  it sounds like a large order said mary anything else  you must ask god to forgive the sins youve committed  but ive never com committed any said mary whats a sin any way  oh mary you must have everybody does did you never tell a lie  heaps of ‘em said mary  thats a dreadful sin said una solemnly  do you mean to tell me demanded mary that id be sent to hell for telling a lie now and then why i had to mr wiley would have broken every bone in my body one time if i hadnt told him a lie lies have saved me many a whack i can tell you  una sighed here were too many difficulties for her to solve she shuddered as she thought of being cruelly whipped very likely she would have lied too she squeezed marys little calloused hand  is that the only dress youve got asked faith whose joyous nature refused to dwell on disagreeable subjects  i just put on this dress because it was no good cried mary flushing mrs wileyd bought my clothes and i wasnt going to be beholden to her for anything and im honest if i was going to run away i wasnt going to take what belong to her that was worth anything when i grow up im going to have a blue sating dress your own clothes dont look so stylish i thought ministers children were always dressed up  it was plain that mary had a temper and was sensitive on some points but there was a queer wild charm about her which captivated them all she was taken to rainbow valley that afternoon and introduced to the blythes as a friend of ours from over harbour who is visiting us the blythes accepted her unquestioningly perhaps because she was fairly respectable now after dinner through which aunt martha had mumbled and mr meredith had been in a state of semi unconsciousness while brooding his sunday sermon faith had prevailed on mary to put on one of her dresses as well as certain other articles of clothing with her hair neatly braided mary passed muster tolerably well she was an acceptable playmate for she knew several new and exciting games and her conversation lacked not spice in fact some of her expressions made nan and di look at her rather askance they were not quite sure what their mother would have thought of her but they knew quite well what susan would however she was a visitor at the manse so she must be all right  when bedtime came there was the problem of where mary should sleep  we cant put her in the spare room you know said faith perplexedly to una  i havent got anything in my head cried mary in an injured tone  oh i didnt mean that protested faith the spare room is all torn up the mice have gnawed a big hole in the feather tick and made a nest in it we never found it out till aunt martha put the rev mr fisher from charlottetown there to sleep last week he soon found it out then father had to give him his bed and sleep on the study lounge aunt martha hasnt had time to fix the spare room bed up yet so she says so nobody can sleep there no matter how clean their heads are and our room is so small and the bed so small you cant sleep with us  i can go back to the hay in the old barn for the night if youll lend me a quilt said mary philosophically it was kind of chilly last night but ‘cept for that ive had worse beds  oh no no you mustnt do that said una ive thought of a plan faith you know that little trestle bed in the garret room with the old mattress on it that the last minister left there lets take up the spare room bedclothes and make mary a bed there you wont mind sleeping in the garret will you mary its just above our room  any placell do me laws i never had a decent place to sleep in my life i slept in the loft over the kitchen at mrs wileys the roof leaked rain in the summer and the snow druv in in winter my bed was a straw tick on the floor you wont find me a mite huffy about where i sleep  the manse garret was a long low shadowy place with one gable end partitioned off here a bed was made up for mary of the dainty hemstitched sheets and embroidered spread which cecilia meredith had once so proudly made for her spare room and which still survived aunt marthas uncertain washings the good nights were said and silence fell over the manse una was just falling asleep when she heard a sound in the room just above that made her sit up suddenly  listen faith marys crying she whispered faith replied not being already asleep una slipped out of bed and made her way in her little white gown down the hall and up the garret stairs the creaking floor gave ample notice of her coming and when she reached the corner room all was moonlit silence and the trestle bed showed only a hump in the middle  mary whispered una  there was no response  una crept close to the bed and pulled at the spread mary i know you are crying i heard you are you lonesome  mary suddenly appeared to view but said nothing  let me in beside you im cold said una shivering in the chilly air for the little garret window was open and the keen breath of the north shore at night blew in  mary moved over and una snuggled down beside her  now you wont be lonesome we shouldnt have left you here alone the first night  i wasnt lonesome sniffed mary  what were you crying for then  oh i just got to thinking of things when i was here alone i thought of having to go back to mrs wiley and of being licked for running away and and and of going to hell for telling lies it all worried me something scandalous  oh mary said poor una in distress i dont believe god will send you to hell for telling lies when you didnt know it was wrong he couldnt why hes kind and good of course you mustnt tell any more now that you know its wrong  if i cant tell lies whats to become of me said mary with a sob you dont understand you dont know anything about it youve got a home and a kind father though it does seem to me that he isnt moren about half there but anyway he doesnt lick you and you get enough to eat such as it is though that old aunt of yours doesnt know anything about cooking why this is the first day i ever remember of feeling ‘sif id enough to eat ive been knocked about all of my life ‘cept for the two years i was at the asylum they didnt lick me there and it wasnt too bad though the matron was cross she always looked ready to bite my head off a nail but mrs wiley is a holy terror thats what she is and im just scared stiff when i think of going back to her  perhaps you wont have to perhaps well be able to think of a way out lets both ask god to keep you from having to go back to mrs wiley you say your prayers dont you mary  oh yes i always go over an old rhyme ‘fore i get into bed said mary indifferently i never thought of asking for anything in particular though nobody in this world ever bothered themselves about me so i didnt spose god would he might take more trouble for you seeing youre a ministers daughter  hed take every bit as much trouble for you mary im sure said una it doesnt matter whose child you are you just ask him and i will too  all right agreed mary it wont do any harm if it doesnt do much good if you knew mrs wiley as well as i do you wouldnt think god would want to meddle with her anyhow i wont cry any more about it this is a big sight bettern last night down in that old barn with the mice running about look at the four winds light aint it pretty  this is the only window we can see it from said una i love to watch it  do you so do i i could see it from the wiley loft and it was the only comfort i had when i was all sore from being licked id watch it and forget about the places that hurt id think of the ships sailing away and away from it and wish i was on one of them sailing far away too away from everything on winter nights when it didnt shine i just felt real lonesome say una what makes all you folks so kind to me when im just a stranger  because its right to be the bible tells us to be kind to everybody  does it well i guess most folks dont mind it much then i never remember of any one being kind to me before trues you live i dont say una aint them shadows on the walls pretty they look just like a flock of little dancing birds and say una i like all you folks and them blythe boys and di but i dont like that nan shes a proud one  oh no mary she isnt a bit proud said una eagerly not a single bit  dont tell me any one that holds her head like that is proud i dont like her  we all like her very much  oh i spose you like her bettern me said mary jealously do you  why mary weve known her for weeks and weve only known you a few hours stammered una  so you do like her better then said mary in a rage all right like her all you want to i dont care i can get along without you  she flung herself over against the wall of the garret with a slam  oh mary said una pushing a tender arm over marys uncompromising back dont talk like that i do like you ever so much and you make me feel so bad  no answer presently una gave a sob instantly mary squirmed around again and engulfed una in a bears hug  hush up she ordered dont go crying over what i said i was as mean as the devil to talk that way i orter to be skinned alive and you all so good to me i should think you would like any one bettern me i deserve every licking i ever got hush now if you cry any more ill go and walk right down to the harbour in this night dress and drown myself  this terrible threat made una choke back her sobs her tears were wiped away by mary with the lace frill of the spare room pillow and forgiver and forgiven cuddled down together again harmony restored to watch the shadows of the vine leaves on the moonlit wall until they fell asleep  and in the study below rev john meredith walked the floor with rapt face and shining eyes thinking out his message of the morrow and knew not that under his own roof there was a little forlorn soul stumbling in darkness and ignorance beset by terror and compassed about with difficulties too great for it to grapple in its unequal struggle with a big indifferent world     chapter vi mary stays at the manse   the manse children took mary vance to church with them the next day at first mary objected to the idea  didnt you go to church over harbour asked una  you bet mrs wiley never troubled church much but i went every sunday i could get off i was mighty thankful to go to some place where i could sit down for a spell but i cant go to church in this old ragged dress  this difficulty was removed by faith offering the loan of her second best dress  its faded a little and two of the buttons are off but i guess itll do  ill sew the buttons on in a jiffy said mary  not on sunday said una shocked  sure the better the day the better the deed you just gimme a needle and thread and look the other way if youre squeamish  faiths school boots and an old black velvet cap that had once been cecilia merediths completed marys costume and to church she went her behaviour was quite conventional and though some wondered who the shabby little girl with the manse children was she did not attract much attention she listened to the sermon with outward decorum and joined lustily in the singing she had it appeared a clear strong voice and a good ear  his blood can make the violets clean carolled mary blithely mrs jimmy milgrave whose pew was just in front of the manse pew turned suddenly and looked the child over from top to toe mary in a mere superfluity of naughtiness stuck out her tongue at mrs milgrave much to unas horror  i couldnt help it she declared after church whatd she want to stare at me like that for such manners im glad stuck my tongue out at her i wish id stuck it farther out say i saw rob macallister from over harbour there wonder if hell tell mrs wiley on me  no mrs wiley appeared however and in a few day the children forgot to look for her mary was apparently a fixture at the manse but she refused to go to school with the others  nope ive finished my education she said when faith urged her to go i went to school four winters since i come to mrs wileys and ive had all i want of that im sick and tired of being everlastingly jawed at ‘cause i didnt get my home lessons done id no time to do home lessons  our teacher wont jaw you he is awfully nice said faith  well i aint going i can read and write and cipher up to fractions thats all i want you fellows go and ill stay home you neednt be scared ill steal anything i swear im honest  mary employed herself while the others were at school in cleaning up the manse in a few days it was a different place floors were swept furniture dusted everything straightened out she mended the spare room bed tick she sewed on missing buttons she patched clothes neatly she even invaded the study with broom and dustpan and ordered mr meredith out while she put it to rights but there was one department with which aunt martha refused to let her interfere aunt martha might be deaf and half blind and very childish but she was resolved to keep the commissariat in her own hands in spite of all marys wiles and stratagems  i can tell you if old marthad let me cook youd have some decent meals she told the manse children indignantly thered be no more ‘ditto and no more lumpy porridge and blue milk either what does she do with all the cream  she gives it to the cat hes hers you know said faith  id like to cat her exclaimed mary bitterly ive no use for cats anyhow they belong to the old nick you can tell that by their eyes well if old martha wont she wont i spose but it gits on my nerves to see good vittles spoiled  when school came out they always went to rainbow valley mary refused to play in the graveyard she declared she was afraid of ghosts  theres no such thing as ghosts declared jem blythe  oh aint there  did you ever see any  hundreds of ‘em said mary promptly  what are they like said carl  awful looking dressed all in white with skellington hands and heads said mary  what did you do asked una  run like the devil said mary then she caught walters eyes and blushed mary was a good deal in awe of walter she declared to the manse girls that his eyes made her nervous  i think of all the lies ive ever told when i look into them she said and i wish i hadnt  jem was marys favourite when he took her to the attic at ingleside and showed her the museum of curios that captain jim boyd had bequeathed to him she was immensely pleased and flattered she also won carls heart entirely by her interest in his beetles and ants it could not be denied that mary got on rather better with the boys than with the girls she quarrelled bitterly with nan blythe the second day  your mother is a witch she told nan scornfully red haired women are always witches then she and faith fell out about the rooster mary said its tail was too short faith angrily retorted that she guessed god know what length to make a roosters tail they did not speak for a day over this mary treated unas hairless one eyed doll with consideration but when una showed her other prized treasure a picture of an angel carrying a baby presumably to heaven mary declared that it looked too much like a ghost for her una crept away to her room and cried over this but mary hunted her out hugged her repentantly and implored forgiveness no one could keep up a quarrel long with mary not even nan who was rather prone to hold grudges and never quite forgave the insult to her mother mary was jolly she could and did tell the most thrilling ghost stories rainbow valley seances were undeniably more exciting after mary came she learned to play on the jews harp and soon eclipsed jerry  never struck anything yet i couldnt do if i put my mind to it she declared mary seldom lost a chance of tooting her own horn she taught them how to make blow bags out of the thick leaves of the live forever that flourished in the old bailey garden she initiated them into the toothsome qualities of the sours that grew in the niches of the graveyard dyke and she could make the most wonderful shadow pictures on the walls with her long flexible fingers and when they all went picking gum in rainbow valley mary always got the biggest chew and bragged about it there were times when they hated her and times when they loved her but at all times they found her interesting so they submitted quite meekly to her bossing and by the end of a fortnight had come to feel that she must always have been with them  its the queerest thing that mrs wiley haint been after me said mary i cant understand it  maybe she isnt going to bother about you at all said una then you can just go on staying here  this house aint hardly big enough for me and old martha said mary darkly its a very fine thing to have enough to eat ive often wondered what it would be like but im pticler about my cooking and mrs wileyll be here yet shes got a rod in pickle for me all right i dont think about it so much in daytime but say girls up there in that garret at night i git to thinking and thinking of it till i just almost wish shed come and have it over with i dunnos one real good whipping would be much worsen all the dozen ive lived through in my mind ever since i run away were any of you ever licked  no of course not said faith indignantly father would never do such a thing  you dont know youre alive said mary with a sigh half of envy half of superiority you dont know what ive come through and i spose the blythes were never licked either  no o o i guess not but i think they were sometimes spanked when they were small  a spanking doesnt amount to anything said mary contemptuously if my folks had just spanked me id have thought they were petting me well it aint a fair world i wouldnt mind taking my share of wallopings but ive had a darn sight too many  it isnt right to say that word mary said una reproachfully you promised me you wouldnt say it  gway responded mary if you knew some of the words i could say if i liked you wouldnt make such a fuss over darn and you know very well i haint ever told any lies since i come here  what about all those ghosts you said you saw asked faith  mary blushed  that was diffrunt she said defiantly i knew you wouldnt believe them yarns and i didnt intend you to and i really did see something queer one night when i was passing the over harbour graveyard trues you live i dunno whether ‘twas a ghost or sandy crawfords old white nag but it looked blamed queer and i tell you i scooted at the rate of no mans business     chapter vii a fishy episode   rilla blythe walked proudly and perhaps a little primly through the main street of the glen and up the manse hill carefully carrying a small basketful of early strawberries which susan had coaxed into lusciousness in one of the sunny nooks of ingleside susan had charged rilla to give the basket to nobody except aunt martha or mr meredith and rilla very proud of being entrusted with such an errand was resolved to carry out her instructions to the letter  susan had dressed her daintily in a white starched and embroidered dress with sash of blue and beaded slippers her long ruddy curls were sleek and round and susan had let her put on her best hat out of compliment to the manse it was a somewhat elaborate affair wherein susans taste had had more to say than annes and rillas small soul gloried in its splendours of silk and lace and flowers she was very conscious of her hat and i am afraid she strutted up the manse hill the strut or the hat or both got on the nerves of mary vance who was swinging on the lawn gate marys temper was somewhat ruffled just then into the bargain aunt martha had refused to let her peel the potatoes and had ordered her out of the kitchen  yah youll bring the potatoes to the table with strips of skin hanging to them and half boiled as usual my but itll be nice to go to your funeral shrieked mary she went out of the kitchen giving the door such a bang that even aunt martha heard it and mr meredith in his study felt the vibration and thought absently that there must have been a slight earthquake shock then he went on with his sermon  mary slipped from the gate and confronted the spick and span damsel of ingleside  what you got there she demanded trying to take the basket  rilla resisted itth for mithter meredith she lisped  give it to me ill give it to him said mary  no thuthan thaid that i wathnt to give it to anybody but mithter merdith or aunt martha insisted rilla  mary eyed her sourly  you think youre something dont you all dressed up like a doll look at me my dress is all rags and i dont care id rather be ragged than a doll baby go home and tell them to put you in a glass case look at me look at me look at me  mary executed a wild dance around the dismayed and bewildered rilla flirting her ragged skirt and vociferating look at me look at me until poor rilla was dizzy but as the latter tried to edge away towards the gate mary pounced on her again  you give me that basket she ordered with a grimace mary was past mistress in the art of making faces she could give her countenance a most grotesque and unearthly appearance out of which her strange brilliant white eyes gleamed with weird effect  i wont gasped rilla frightened but staunch you let me go mary vanth  mary let go for a minute and looked around her just inside the gate was a small flake on which a half a dozen large codfish were drying one of mr merediths parishioners had presented him with them one day perhaps in lieu of the subscription he was supposed to pay to the stipend and never did mr meredith had thanked him and then forgotten all about the fish which would have promptly spoiled had not the indefatigable mary prepared them for drying and rigged up the flake herself on which to dry them  mary had a diabolical inspiration she flew to the flake and seized the largest fish there a huge flat thing nearly as big as herself with a whoop she swooped down on the terrified rilla brandishing her weird missile rillas courage gave way to be lambasted with a dried codfish was such an unheard of thing that rilla could not face it with a shriek she dropped her basket and fled the beautiful berries which susan had so tenderly selected for the minister rolled in a rosy torrent over the dusty road and were trodden on by the flying feet of pursuer and pursued the basket and contents were no longer in marys mind she thought only of the delight of giving rilla blythe the scare of her life she would teach her to come giving herself airs because of her fine clothes  rilla flew down the hill and along the street terror lent wings to her feet and she just managed to keep ahead of mary who was somewhat hampered by her own laughter but who had breath enough to give occasional blood curdling whoops as she ran flourishing her codfish in the air through the glen street they swept while everybody ran to the windows and gates to see them mary felt she was making a tremendous sensation and enjoyed it rilla blind with terror and spent of breath felt that she could run no longer in another instant that terrible girl would be on her with the codfish at this point the poor mite stumbled and fell into the mud puddle at the end of the street just as miss cornelia came out of carter flaggs store  miss cornelia took the whole situation in at a glance so did mary the latter stopped short in her mad career and before miss cornelia could speak she had whirled around and was running up as fast as she had run down miss cornelias lips tightened ominously but she knew it was no use to think of chasing her so she picked up poor sobbing dishevelled rilla instead and took her home rilla was heart broken her dress and slippers and hat were ruined and her six year old pride had received terrible bruises  susan white with indignation heard miss cornelias story of mary vances exploit  oh the hussy oh the littly hussy she said as she carried rilla away for purification and comfort  this thing has gone far enough anne dearie said miss cornelia resolutely something must be done who is this creature who is staying at the manse and where does she come from  i understood she was a little girl from over harbour who was visiting at the manse answered anne who saw the comical side of the codfish chase and secretly thought rilla was rather vain and needed a lesson or two  i know all the over harbour families who come to our church and that imp doesnt belong to any of them retorted miss cornelia she is almost in rags and when she goes to church she wears faith merediths old clothes theres some mystery here and im going to investigate it since it seems nobody else will i believe she was at the bottom of their goings on in warren meads spruce bush the other day did you hear of their frightening his mother into a fit  no i knew gilbert had been called to see her but i did not hear what the trouble was  well you know she has a weak heart and one day last week when she was all alone on the veranda she heard the most awful shrieks of ‘murder and ‘help coming from the bush positively frightful sounds anne dearie her heart gave out at once warren heard them himself at the barn and went straight to the bush to investigate and there he found all the manse children sitting on a fallen tree and screaming ‘murder at the top of their lungs they told him they were only in fun and didnt think anyone would hear them they were just playing indian ambush warren went back to the house and found his poor mother unconscious on the veranda  susan who had returned sniffed contemptuously  i think she was very far from being unconscious mrs marshall elliott and that you may tie to i have been hearing of amelia warrens weak heart for forty years she had it when she was twenty she enjoys making a fuss and having the doctor and any excuse will do  i dont think gilbert thought her attack very serious said anne  oh that may very well be said miss cornelia but the matter has made an awful lot of talk and the meads being methodists makes it that much worse what is going to become of those children sometimes i cant sleep at nights for thinking about them anne dearie i really do question if they get enough to eat even for their father is so lost in dreams that he doesnt often remember he has a stomach and that lazy old woman doesnt bother cooking what she ought they are just running wild and now that school is closing theyll be worse than ever  they do have jolly times said anne laughing over the recollections of some rainbow valley happenings that had come to her ears and they are all brave and frank and loyal and truthful  thats a true word anne dearie and when you come to think of all the trouble in the church those two tattling deceitful youngsters of the last ministers made im inclined to overlook a good deal in the merediths  when all is said and done mrs dr dear they are very nice children said susan they have got plenty of original sin in them and that i will admit but maybe it is just as well for if they had not they might spoil from over sweetness only i do think it is not proper for them to play in a graveyard and that i will maintain  but they really play quite quietly there excused anne they dont run and yell as they do elsewhere such howls as drift up here from rainbow valley sometimes though i fancy my own small fry bear a valiant part in them they had a sham battle there last night and had to ‘roar themselves because they had no artillery to do it so jem says jem is passing through the stage where all boys hanker to be soldiers  well thank goodness hell never be a soldier said miss cornelia i never approved of our boys going to that south african fracas but its over and not likely anything of the kind will ever happen again i think the world is getting more sensible as for the merediths ive said many a time and i say it again if mr meredith had a wife all would be well  he called twice at the kirks last week so i am told said susan  well said miss cornelia thoughtfully as a rule i dont approve of a minister marrying in his congregation it generally spoils him but in this case it would do no harm for every one likes elizabeth kirk and nobody else is hankering for the job of stepmothering those youngsters even the hill girls balk at that they havent been found laying traps for mr meredith elizabeth would make him a good wife if he only thought so but the trouble is she really is homely and anne dearie mr meredith abstracted as he is has an eye for a good looking woman man like he isnt so other worldly when it comes to that believe me  elizabeth kirk is a very nice person but they do say that people have nearly frozen to death in her mothers spare room bed before now mrs dr dear said susan darkly if i felt i had any right to express an opinion concerning such a solemn matter as a ministers marriage i would say that i think elizabeths cousin sarah over harbour would make mr meredith a better wife  why sarah kirk is a methodist said miss cornelia much as if susan had suggested a hottentot as a manse bride  she would likely turn presbyterian if she married mr meredith retorted susan  miss cornelia shook her head evidently with her it was once a methodist always a methodist  sarah kirk is entirely out of the question she said positively and so is emmeline drew though the drews are all trying to make the match they are literally throwing poor emmeline at his head and he hasnt the least idea of it  emmeline drew has no gumption i must allow said susan she is the kind of woman mrs dr dear who would put a hot water bottle in your bed on a dog night and then have her feelings hurt because you were not grateful and her mother was a very poor housekeeper did you ever hear the story of her dishcloth she lost her dishcloth one day but the next day she found it oh yes mrs dr dear she found it in the goose at the dinner table mixed up with the stuffing do you think a woman like that would do for a ministers mother in law i do not but no doubt i would be better employed in mending little jems trousers than in talking gossip about my neighbours he tore them something scandalous last night in rainbow valley  where is walter asked anne  he is up to no good i fear mrs dr dear he is in the attic writing something in an exercise book and he has not done as well in arithmetic this term as he should so the teacher tells me too well i know the reason why he has been writing silly rhymes when he should have been doing his sums i am afraid that boy is going to be a poet mrs dr dear  he is a poet now susan  well you take it real calm mrs dr dear i suppose it is the best way when a person has the strength i had an uncle who began by being a poet and ended up by being a tramp our family were dreadfully ashamed of him  you dont seem to think very highly of poets susan said anne laughing  who does mrs dr dear asked susan in genuine astonishment  what about milton and shakespeare and the poets of the bible  they tell me milton could not get along with his wife and shakespeare was no more than respectable by times as for the bible of course things were different in those sacred days although i never had a high opinion of king david say what you will i never knew any good to come of writing poetry and i hope and pray that blessed boy will outgrow the tendency if he does not we must see what emulsion of cod liver oil will do     chapter viii miss cornelia intervenes   miss cornelia descended upon the manse the next day and cross questioned mary who being a young person of considerable discernment and astuteness told her story simple and truthfully with an entire absence of complaint or bravado miss cornelia was more favourably impressed than she had expected to be but deemed it her duty to be severe  do you think she said sternly that you showed your gratitude to this family who have been far too kind to you by insulting and chasing one of their little friends as you did yesterday  say it was rotten mean of me admitted mary easily i dunno what possessed me that old codfish seemed to come in so blamed handy but i was awful sorry i cried last night after i went to bed about it honest i did you ask una if i didnt i wouldnt tell her what for ‘cause i was ashamed of it and then she cried too because she was afraid someone had hurt my feelings laws i aint got any feelings to hurt worth speaking of what worries me is why mrs wiley haint been hunting for me it aint like her  miss cornelia herself thought it rather peculiar but she merely admonished mary sharply not to take any further liberties with the ministers codfish and went to report progress at ingleside  if the childs story is true the matter ought to be looked into she said i know something about that wiley woman believe me marshall used to be well acquainted with her when he lived over harbour i heard him say something last summer about her and a home child she had likely this very mary creature he said some one told him she was working the child to death and not half feeding and clothing it you know anne dearie it has always been my habit neither to make nor meddle with those over harbour folks but i shall send marshall over to morrow to find out the rights of this if he can and then ill speak to the minister mind you anne dearie the merediths found this girl literally starving in james taylors old hay barn she had been there all night cold and hungry and alone and us sleeping warm in our beds after good suppers  the poor little thing said anne picturing one of her own dear babies cold and hungry and alone in such circumstances if she has been ill used miss cornelia she mustnt be taken back to such a place i was an orphan once in a very similar situation  well have to consult the hopetown asylum folks said miss cornelia anyway she cant be left at the manse dear knows what those poor children might learn from her i understand that she has been known to swear but just think of her being there two whole weeks and mr meredith never waking up to it what business has a man like that to have a family why anne dearie he ought to be a monk  two evenings later miss cornelia was back at ingleside  its the most amazing thing she said mrs wiley was found dead in her bed the very morning after this mary creature ran away she has had a bad heart for years and the doctor had warned her it might happen at any time she had sent away her hired man and there was nobody in the house some neighbours found her the next day they missed the child it seems but supposed mrs wiley had sent her to her cousin near charlottetown as she had said she was going to do the cousin didnt come to the funeral and so nobody ever knew that mary wasnt with her the people marshall talked to told him some things about the way mrs wiley used this mary that made his blood boil so he declares you know it puts marshall in a regular fury to hear of a child being ill used they said she whipped her mercilessly for every little fault or mistake some folks talked of writing to the asylum authorities but everybodys business is nobodys business and it was never done  i am sorry that wiley person is dead said susan fiercely i should like to go over harbour and give her a piece of my mind starving and beating a child mrs dr dear as you know i hold with lawful spanking but i go no further and what is to become of this poor child now mrs marshall elliott  i suppose she must be sent back to hopetown said miss cornelia i think every one hereabouts who wants a home child has one ill see mr meredith to morrow and tell him my opinion of the whole affair  and no doubt she will mrs dr dear said susan after miss cornelia had gone she would stick at nothing not even at shingling the church spire if she took it into her head but i cannot understand how even cornelia bryant can talk to a minister as she does you would think he was just any common person  when miss cornelia had gone nan blythe uncurled herself from the hammock where she had been studying her lessons and slipped away to rainbow valley the others were already there jem and jerry were playing quoits with old horseshoes borrowed from the glen blacksmith carl was stalking ants on a sunny hillock walter lying on his stomach among the fern was reading aloud to mary and di and faith and una from a wonderful book of myths wherein were fascinating accounts of prester john and the wandering jew divining rods and tailed men of schamir the worm that split rocks and opened the way to golden treasure of fortunate isles and swan maidens it was a great shock to walter to learn that william tell and gelert were myths also and the story of bishop hatto was to keep him awake all that night but best of all he loved the stories of the pied piper and the san greal he read them thrillingly while the bells on the tree lovers tinkled in the summer wind and the coolness of the evening shadows crept across the valley  say aint them inresting lies said mary admiringly when walter had closed the book  they arent lies said di indignantly  you dont mean theyre true asked mary incredulously  no not exactly theyre like those ghost stories of yours they werent true but you didnt expect us to believe them so they werent lies  that yarn about the divining rod is no lie anyhow said mary old jake crawford over harbour can work it they send for him from everywhere when they want to dig a well and i believe i know the wandering jew  oh mary said una awe struck  i do trues youre alive there was an old man at mrs wileys one day last fall he looked old enough to be anything she was asking him about cedar posts if he thought theyd last well and he said ‘last well theyll last a thousand years i know for ive tried them twice now if he was two thousand years old who was he but your wandering jew  i dont believe the wandering jew would associate with a person like mrs wiley said faith decidedly  i love the pied piper story said di and so does mother i always feel so sorry for the poor little lame boy who couldnt keep up with the others and got shut out of the mountain he must have been so disappointed i think all the rest of his life hed be wondering what wonderful thing he had missed and wishing he could have got in with the others  but how glad his mother must have been said una softly i think she had been sorry all her life that he was lame perhaps she even used to cry about it but she would never be sorry again never she would be glad he was lame because that was why she hadnt lost him  some day said walter dreamily looking afar into the sky the pied piper will come over the hill up there and down rainbow valley piping merrily and sweetly and i will follow him follow him down to the shore down to the sea away from you all i dont think ill want to go jem will want to go it will be such an adventure but i wont only ill have to the music will call and call and call me until i must follow  well all go cried di catching fire at the flame of walters fancy and half believing she could see the mocking retreating figure of the mystic piper in the far dim end of the valley  no youll sit here and wait said walter his great splendid eyes full of strange glamour youll wait for us to come back and we may not come for we cannot come as long as the piper plays he may pipe us round the world and still youll sit here and wait and wait  oh dry up said mary shivering dont look like that walter blythe you give me the creeps do you want to set me bawling i could just see that horrid old piper going away on and you boys following him and us girls sitting here waiting all alone i dunno why it is i never was one of the blubbering kind but as soon as you start your spieling i always want to cry  walter smiled in triumph he liked to exercise this power of his over his companions to play on their feelings waken their fears thrill their souls it satisfied some dramatic instinct in him but under his triumph was a queer little chill of some mysterious dread the pied piper had seemed very real to him as if the fluttering veil that hid the future had for a moment been blown aside in the starlit dusk of rainbow valley and some dim glimpse of coming years granted to him  carl coming up to their group with a report of the doings in ant land brought them all back to the realm of facts  ants are darned inresting exclaimed mary glad to escape the shadowy pipers thrall carl and me watched that bed in the graveyard all saturday afternoon i never thought there was so much in bugs say but theyre quarrelsome little cusses some of ‘em like to start a fight ‘thout any reason fars we could see and some of ‘em are cowards they got so scared they just doubled theirselves up into a ball and let the other fellows bang ‘em they wouldnt put up a fight at all some of ‘em are lazy and wont work we watched ‘em shirking and there was one ant died of grief ‘cause another ant got killed wouldnt work wouldnt eat just died it did honest to go oodness  a shocked silence prevailed every one knew that mary had not started out to say goodness faith and di exchanged glances that would have done credit to miss cornelia herself walter and carl looked uncomfortable and unas lip trembled  mary squirmed uncomfortably  that slipped out ‘fore i thought it did honest to i mean trues you live and i swallowed half of it you folks over here are mighty squeamish seems to me wish you could have heard the wileys when they had a fight  ladies dont say such things said faith very primly for her  it isnt right whispered una  i aint a lady said mary what chanceve i ever had of being a lady but i wont say that again if i can help it i promise you  besides said una you cant expect god to answer your prayers if you take his name in vain mary  i dont expect him to answer ‘em anyhow said mary of little faith ive been asking him for a week to clear up this wiley affair and he hasnt done a thing im going to give up  at this juncture nan arrived breathless  oh mary ive news for you mrs elliott has been over harbour and what do you think she found out mrs wiley is dead she was found dead in bed the morning after you ran away so youll never have to go back to her  dead said mary stupefied then she shivered  do you spose my praying had anything to do with that she cried imploringly to una if it had ill never pray again as long as i live why she may come back and hant me  no no mary said una comfortingly it hadnt why mrs wiley died long before you ever began to pray about it at all  thats so said mary recovering from her panic but i tell you it gave me a start i wouldnt like to think id prayed anybody to death i never thought of such a thing as her dying when i was praying she didnt seem much like the dying kind did mrs elliott say anything about me  she said you would likely have to go back to the asylum  i thought as much said mary drearily and then theyll give me out again likely to some one just like mrs wiley well i spose i can stand it im tough  im going to pray that you wont have to go back whispered una as she and mary walked home to the manse  you can do as you like said mary decidedly but i vow i wont im good and scared of this praying business see whats come of it if mrs wiley had died after i started praying it would have been my doings  oh no it wouldnt said una i wish i could explain things better father could i know if youd talk to him mary  catch me i dont know what to make of your father thats the long and short of it he goes by me and never sees me in broad daylight i aint proud but i aint a door mat neither  oh mary its just fathers way most of the time he never sees us either he is thinking deeply that is all and i am going to pray that god will keep you in four winds because i like you mary  all right only dont let me hear of any more people dying on account of it said mary id like to stay in four winds fine i like it and i like the harbour and the light house and you and the blythes youre the only friends i ever had and id hate to leave you     chapter ix una intervenes   miss cornelia had an interview with mr meredith which proved something of a shock to that abstracted gentleman she pointed out to him none too respectfully his dereliction of duty in allowing a waif like mary vance to come into his family and associate with his children without knowing or learning anything about her  i dont say there is much harm done of course she concluded this mary creature isnt what you might call bad when all is said and done ive been questioning your children and the blythes and from what i can make out theres nothing much to be said against the child except that shes slangy and doesnt use very refined language but think what might have happened if shed been like some of those home children we know of you know yourself what that poor little creature the jim flaggs had taught and told the flagg children  mr meredith did know and was honestly shocked over his own carelessness in the matter  but what is to be done mrs elliott he asked helplessly we cant turn the poor child out she must be cared for  of course wed better write to the hopetown authorities at once meanwhile i suppose she might as well stay here for a few more days till we hear from them but keep your eyes and ears open mr meredith  susan would have died of horror on the spot if she had heard miss cornelia so admonishing a minister but miss cornelia departed in a warm glow of satisfaction over duty done and that night mr meredith asked mary to come into his study with him mary obeyed looking literally ghastly with fright but she got the surprise of her poor battered little life this man of whom she had stood so terribly in awe was the kindest gentlest soul she had ever met before she knew what happened mary found herself pouring all her troubles into his ear and receiving in return such sympathy and tender understanding as it had never occurred to her to imagine mary left the study with her face and eyes so softened that una hardly knew her  your fathers all right when he does wake up she said with a sniff that just escaped being a sob its a pity he doesnt wake up oftener he said i wasnt to blame for mrs wiley dying but that i must try to think of her good points and not of her bad ones i dunno what good points she had unless it was keeping her house clean and making first class butter i know i ‘most wore my arms out scrubbing her old kitchen floor with the knots in it but anything your father says goes with me after this  mary proved a rather dull companion in the following days however she confided to una that the more she thought of going back to the asylum the more she hated it una racked her small brains for some way of averting it but it was nan blythe who came to the rescue with a somewhat startling suggestion  mrs elliott might take mary herself she has a great big house and mr elliott is always wanting her to have help it would be just a splendid place for mary only shed have to behave herself  oh nan do you think mrs elliott would take her  it wouldnt do any harm if you asked her said nan at first una did not think she could she was so shy that to ask a favour of anybody was agony to her and she was very much in awe of the bustling energetic mrs elliott she liked her very much and always enjoyed a visit to her house but to go and ask her to adopt mary vance seemed such a height of presumption that unas timid spirit quailed  when the hopetown authorities wrote to mr meredith to send mary to them without delay mary cried herself to sleep in the manse attic that night and una found a desperate courage the next evening she slipped away from the manse to the harbour road far down in rainbow valley she heard joyous laughter but her way lay not there she was terribly pale and terribly in earnest so much so that she took no notice of the people she met and old mrs stanley flagg was quite huffed and said una meredith would be as absentminded as her father when she grew up  miss cornelia lived half way between the glen and four winds point in a house whose original glaring green hue had mellowed down to an agreeable greenish gray marshall elliott had planted trees about it and set out a rose garden and a spruce hedge it was quite a different place from what it had been in years agone the manse children and the ingleside children liked to go there it was a beautiful walk down the old harbour road and there was always a well filled cooky jar at the end  the misty sea was lapping softly far down on the sands three big boats were skimming down the harbour like great white sea birds a schooner was coming up the channel the world of four winds was steeped in glowing colour and subtle music and strange glamour and everybody should have been happy in it but when una turned in at miss cornelias gate her very legs had almost refused to carry her  miss cornelia was alone on the veranda una had hoped mr elliott would be there he was so big and hearty and twinkly that there would be encouragement in his presence she sat on the little stool miss cornelia brought out and tried to eat the doughnut miss cornelia gave her it stuck in her throat but she swallowed desperately lest miss cornelia be offended she could not talk she was still pale and her big dark blue eyes looked so piteous that miss cornelia concluded the child was in some trouble  whats on your mind dearie she asked theres something thats plain to be seen  una swallowed the last twist of doughnut with a desperate gulp  mrs elliott wont you take mary vance she said beseechingly  miss cornelia stared blankly  me take mary vance do you mean keep her  yes keep her adopt her said una eagerly gaining courage now that the ice was broken oh mrs elliott please do she doesnt want to go back to the asylum she cries every night about it shes so afraid of being sent to another hard place and shes so smart there isnt anything she cant do i know you wouldnt be sorry if you took her  i never thought of such a thing said miss cornelia rather helplessly  wont you think of it implored una  but dearie i dont want help im quite able to do all the work here and i never thought id like to have a home girl if i did need help  the light went out of unas eyes her lips trembled she sat down on her stool again a pathetic little figure of disappointment and began to cry  dont dearie dont exclaimed miss cornelia in distress she could never bear to hurt a child i dont say i wont take her but the idea is so new it has just kerflummuxed me i must think it over  mary is so smart said una again  humph so ive heard ive heard she swears too is that true  ive never heard her swear exactly faltered una uncomfortably but im afraid she could  i believe you does she always tell the truth  i think she does except when shes afraid of a whipping  and yet you want me to take her  some one has to take her sobbed una some one has to look after her mrs elliott  thats true perhaps it is my duty to do it said miss cornelia with a sigh well ill have to talk it over with mr elliott so dont say anything about it just yet take another doughnut dearie  una took it and ate it with a better appetite  im very fond of doughnuts she confessed aunt martha never makes any but miss susan at ingleside does and sometimes she lets us have a plateful in rainbow valley do you know what i do when im hungry for doughnuts and cant get any mrs elliott  no dearie what  i get out mothers old cook book and read the doughnut recipe and the other recipes they sound so nice i always do that when im hungry especially after weve had ditto for dinner then i read the fried chicken and the roast goose recipes mother could make all those nice things  those manse children will starve to death yet if mr meredith doesnt get married miss cornelia told her husband indignantly after una had gone and he wont and whats to be done and shall we take this mary creature marshall  yes take her said marshall laconically  just like a man said his wife despairingly ‘take her as if that was all there are a hundred things to be considered believe me  take her and well consider them afterwards cornelia said her husband  in the end miss cornelia did take her and went up to announce her decision to the ingleside people first  splendid said anne delightedly ive been hoping you would do that very thing miss cornelia i want that poor child to get a good home i was a homeless little orphan just like her once  i dont think this mary creature is or ever will be much like you retorted miss cornelia gloomily shes a cat of another colour but shes also a human being with an immortal soul to save ive got a shorter catechism and a small tooth comb and im going to do my duty by her now that ive set my hand to the plough believe me  mary received the news with chastened satisfaction  its better luck than i expected she said  youll have to mind your ps and qs with mrs elliott said nan  well i can do that flashed mary i know how to behave when i want to just as well as you nan blythe  you mustnt use bad words you know mary said una anxiously  i spose shed die of horror if i did grinned mary her white eyes shining with unholy glee over the idea but you neednt worry una butter wont melt in my mouth after this ill be all prunes and prisms  nor tell lies added faith  not even to get off from a whipping pleaded mary  mrs elliott will never whip you never exclaimed di  wont she said mary skeptically if i ever find myself in a place where i aint licked ill think its heaven all right no fear of me telling lies then i aint fond of telling ‘em id ruther not if it comes to that  the day before marys departure from the manse they had a picnic in her honour in rainbow valley and that evening all the manse children gave her something from their scanty store of treasured things for a keepsake carl gave her his noahs ark and jerry his second best jews harp faith gave her a little hairbrush with a mirror in the back of it which mary had always considered very wonderful una hesitated between an old beaded purse and a gay picture of daniel in the lions den and finally offered mary her choice mary really hankered after the beaded purse but she knew una loved it so she said  give me daniel id rusher have it ‘cause im partial to lions only i wish theyd et daniel up it would have been more exciting  at bedtime mary coaxed una to sleep with her  its for the last time she said and its raining tonight and i hate sleeping up there alone when its raining on account of that graveyard i dont mind it on fine nights but a night like this i cant see anything but the rain pouring down on them old white stones and the wind round the window sounds as if them dead people were trying to get in and crying ‘cause they couldnt  i like rainy nights said una when they were cuddled down together in the little attic room and so do the blythe girls  i dont mind ‘em when im not handy to graveyards said mary if i was alone here id cry my eyes out id be so lonesome i feel awful bad to be leaving you all  mrs elliott will let you come up and play in rainbow valley quite often im sure said una and you will be a good girl wont you mary  oh ill try sighed mary but it wont be as easy for me to be good inside i mean as well as outside as it is for you you hadnt such scalawags of relations as i had  but your people must have had some good qualities as well as bad ones argued una you must live up to them and never mind their bad ones  i dont believe they had any good qualities said mary gloomily i never heard of any my grandfather had money but they say he was a rascal no ill just have to start out on my own hook and do the best i can  and god will help you you know mary if you ask him  i dont know about that  oh mary you know we asked god to get a home for you and he did  i dont see what he had to do with it retorted mary it was you put it into mrs elliotts head  but god put it into her heart to take you all my putting it into her head wouldnt have done any good if he hadnt  well there may be something in that admitted mary mind you i havent got anything against god una im willing to give him a chance but honest i think hes an awful lot like your father just absent minded and never taking any notice of a body most of the time but sometimes waking up all of a suddent and being awful good and kind and sensible  oh mary no exclaimed horrified una god isnt a bit like father i mean hes a thousand times better and kinder  if hes as good as your father hell do for me said mary when your father was talking to me i felt as if i never could be bad any more  i wish youd talk to father about him sighed una he can explain it all so much better than i can  why so i will next time he wakes up promised mary that night he talked to me in the study he showed me real clear that my praying didnt kill mrs wiley my minds been easy since but im real cautious about praying i guess the old rhyme is the safest say una it seems to me if one has to pray to anybody itd be better to pray to the devil than to god gods good anyhow so you say so he wont do you any harm but from all i can make out the devil needs to be pacified i think the sensible way would be to say to him ‘good devil please dont tempt me just leave me alone please now dont you  oh no no mary im sure it couldnt be right to pray to the devil and it wouldnt do any good because hes bad it might aggravate him and hed be worse than ever  well as to this god matter said mary stubbornly since you and i cant settle it there aint no use in talking more about it until weve a chanct to find out the rights of it ill do the best i can alone till then  if mother was alive she could tell us everything said una with a sigh  i wisht she was alive said mary i dont know whats going to become of you youngsters when im gone anyhow do try and keep the house a little tidy the way people talks about it is scandalous and the first thing you know your father will be getting married again and then your noses will be out of joint  una was startled the idea of her father marrying again had never presented itself to her before she did not like it and she lay silent under the chill of it  stepmothers are awful creatures mary went on i could make your blood run cold if i was to tell you all i know about ‘em the wilson kids across the road from wileys had a stepmother she was just as bad to ‘em as mrs wiley was to me itll be awful if you get a stepmother  im sure we wont said una tremulously father wont marry anybody else  hell be hounded into it i expect said mary darkly all the old maids in the settlement are after him theres no being up to them and the worst of stepmothers is they always set your father against you hed never care anything about you again hed always take her part and her childrens part you see shed make him believe you were all bad  i wish you hadnt told me this mary cried una it makes me feel so unhappy  i only wanted to warn you said mary rather repentantly of course your fathers so absent minded he mightnt happen to think of getting married again but its better to be prepared  long after mary slept serenely little una lay awake her eyes smarting with tears on how dreadful it would be if her father should marry somebody who would make him hate her and jerry and faith and carl she couldnt bear it she couldnt  mary had not instilled any poison of the kind miss cornelia had feared into the manse childrens minds yet she had certainly contrived to do a little mischief with the best of intentions but she slept dreamlessly while una lay awake and the rain fell and the wind wailed around the old gray manse and the rev john meredith forgot to go to bed at all because he was absorbed in reading a life of st augustine it was gray dawn when he finished it and went upstairs wrestling with the problems of two thousand years ago the door of the girls room was open and he saw faith lying asleep rosy and beautiful he wondered where una was perhaps she had gone over to stay all night with the blythe girls she did this occasionally deeming it a great treat john meredith sighed he felt that unas whereabouts ought not to be a mystery to him cecelia would have looked after her better than that  if only cecelia were still with him how pretty and gay she had been how the old manse up at maywater had echoed to her songs and she had gone away so suddenly taking her laughter and music and leaving silence so suddenly that he had never quite got over his feeling of amazement how could she the beautiful and vivid have died  the idea of a second marriage had never presented itself seriously to john meredith he had loved his wife so deeply that he believed he could never care for any woman again he had a vague idea that before very long faith would be old enough to take her mothers place until then he must do the best he could alone he sighed and went to his room where the bed was still unmade aunt martha had forgotten it and mary had not dared to make it because aunt martha had forbidden her to meddle with anything in the ministers room but mr meredith did not notice that it was unmade his last thoughts were of st augustine     chapter x the manse girls clean house   ugh said faith sitting up in bed with a shiver its raining i do hate a rainy sunday sunday is dull enough even when its fine  we oughtnt to find sunday dull said una sleepily trying to pull her drowsy wits together with an uneasy conviction that they had overslept  but we do you know said faith candidly mary vance says most sundays are so dull she could hang herself  we ought to like sunday better than mary vance said una remorsefully were the ministers children  i wish we were a blacksmiths children protested faith angrily hunting for her stockings then people wouldnt expect us to be better than other children just look at the holes in my heels mary darned them all up before she went away but theyre as bad as ever now una get up i cant get the breakfast alone oh dear i wish father and jerry were home you wouldnt think wed miss father much we dont see much of him when he is home and yet everything seems gone i must run in and see how aunt martha is  is she any better asked una when faith returned  no she isnt shes groaning with the misery still maybe we ought to tell dr blythe but she says not she never had a doctor in her life and she isnt going to begin now she says doctors just live by poisoning people do you suppose they do  no of course not said una indignantly im sure dr blythe wouldnt poison anybody  well well have to rub aunt marthas back again after breakfast wed better not make the flannels as hot as we did yesterday  faith giggled over the remembrance they had nearly scalded the skin off poor aunt marthas back una sighed mary vance would have known just what the precise temperature of flannels for a misery back should be mary knew everything they knew nothing and how could they learn save by bitter experience for which in this instance unfortunate aunt martha had paid  the preceding monday mr meredith had left for nova scotia to spend his short vacation taking jerry with him on wednesday aunt martha was suddenly seized with a recurring and mysterious ailment which she always called the misery and which was tolerably certain to attack her at the most inconvenient times she could not rise from her bed any movement causing agony a doctor she flatly refused to have faith and una cooked the meals and waited on her the less said about the meals the better yet they were not much worse than aunt marthas had been there were many women in the village who would have been glad to come and help but aunt martha refused to let her plight be known  you must worry on till i kin git around she groaned thank goodness john isnt here theres a plenty o cold biled meat and bread and you kin try your hand at making porridge  the girls had tried their hand but so far without much success the first day it had been too thin the next day so thick that you could cut it in slices and both days it had been burned  i hate porridge said faith viciously when i have a house of my own im never going to have a single bit of porridge in it  whatll your children do then asked una children have to have porridge or they wont grow everybody says so  theyll have to get along without it or stay runts retorted faith stubbornly here una you stir it while i set the table if i leave it for a minute the horrid stuff will burn its half past nine well be late for sunday school  i havent seen anyone going past yet said una there wont likely be many out just see how its pouring and when theres no preaching the folks wont come from a distance to bring the children  go and call carl said faith  carl it appeared had a sore throat induced by getting wet in the rainbow valley marsh the previous evening while pursuing dragon flies he had come home with dripping stockings and boots and had sat out the evening in them he could not eat any breakfast and faith made him go back to bed again she and una left the table as it was and went to sunday school there was no one in the school room when they got there and no one came they waited until eleven and then went home  there doesnt seem to be anybody at the methodist sunday school either said una  im glad said faith id hate to think the methodists were better at going to sunday school on rainy sundays than the presbyterians but theres no preaching in their church to day either so likely their sunday school is in the afternoon  una washed the dishes doing them quite nicely for so much had she learned from mary vance faith swept the floor after a fashion and peeled the potatoes for dinner cutting her finger in the process  i wish we had something for dinner besides ditto sighed una im so tired of it the blythe children dont know what ditto is and we never have any pudding nan says susan would faint if they had no pudding on sundays why arent we like other people faith  i dont want to be like other people laughed faith tying up her bleeding finger i like being myself its more interesting jessie drew is as good a housekeeper as her mother but would you want to be as stupid as she is  but our house isnt right mary vance says so she says people talk about it being so untidy  faith had an inspiration  well clean it all up she cried well go right to work to morrow its a real good chance when aunt martha is laid up and cant interfere with us well have it all lovely and clean when father comes home just like it was when mary went away any one can sweep and dust and wash windows people wont be able to talk about us any more jem blythe says its only old cats that talk but their talk hurts just as much as anybodys  i hope it will be fine to morrow said una fired with enthusiasm oh faith it will be splendid to be all cleaned up and like other people  i hope aunt marthas misery will last over to morrow said faith if it doesnt we wont get a single thing done  faiths amiable wish was fulfilled the next day found aunt martha still unable to rise carl too was still sick and easily prevailed on to stay in bed neither faith nor una had any idea how sick the boy really was a watchful mother would have had a doctor without delay but there was no mother and poor little carl with his sore throat and aching head and crimson cheeks rolled himself up in his twisted bedclothes and suffered alone somewhat comforted by the companionship of a small green lizard in the pocket of his ragged nighty  the world was full of summer sunshine after the rain it was a peerless day for house cleaning and faith and una went gaily to work  well clean the dining room and the parlour said faith it wouldnt do to meddle with the study and it doesnt matter much about the upstairs the first thing is to take everything out  accordingly everything was taken out the furniture was piled on the veranda and lawn and the methodist graveyard fence was gaily draped with rugs an orgy of sweeping followed with an attempt at dusting on unas part while faith washed the windows of the dining room breaking one pane and cracking two in the process una surveyed the streaked result dubiously  they dont look right somehow she said mrs elliotts and susans windows just shine and sparkle  never mind they let the sunshine through just as well said faith cheerfully they must be clean after all the soap and water ive used and thats the main thing now its past eleven so ill wipe up this mess on the floor and well go outside you dust the furniture and ill shake the rugs im going to do it in the graveyard i dont want to send dust flying all over the lawn  faith enjoyed the rug shaking to stand on hezekiah pollocks tombstone flapping and shaking rugs was real fun to be sure elder abraham clow and his wife driving past in their capacious double seated buggy seemed to gaze at her in grim disapproval  isnt that a terrible sight said elder abraham solemnly  i would never have believed it if i hadnt seen it with my own eyes said mrs elder abraham more solemnly still  faith waved a door mat cheerily at the clow party it did not worry her that the elder and his wife did not return her greeting everybody knew that elder abraham had never been known to smile since he had been appointed superintendent of the sunday school fourteen years previously but it hurt her that minnie and adella clow did not wave back faith liked minnie and adella next to the blythes they were her best friends in school and she always helped adella with her sums this was gratitude for you her friends cut her because she was shaking rugs in an old graveyard where as mary vance said not a living soul had been buried for years faith flounced around to the veranda where she found una grieved in spirit because the clow girls had not waved to her either  i suppose theyre mad over something said faith perhaps theyre jealous because we play so much in rainbow valley with the blythes well just wait till school opens and adella wants me to show her how to do her sums well get square then come on lets put the things back in im tired to death and i dont believe the rooms will look much better than before we started though i shook out pecks of dust in the graveyard i hate house cleaning  it was two oclock before the tired girls finished the two rooms they got a dreary bite in the kitchen and intended to wash the dishes at once but faith happened to pick up a new story book di blythe had lent her and was lost to the world until sunset una took a cup of rank tea up to carl but found him asleep so she curled herself up on jerrys bed and went to sleep too meanwhile a weird story flew through glen st mary and folks asked each other seriously what was to be done with those manse youngsters  that is past laughing at believe me said miss cornelia to her husband with a heavy sigh i couldnt believe it at first miranda drew brought the story home from the methodist sunday school this afternoon and i simply scoffed at it but mrs elder abraham says she and the elder saw it with their own eyes  saw what asked marshall  faith and una meredith stayed home from sunday school this morning and cleaned house said miss cornelia in accents of despair when elder abraham went home from the church he had stayed behind to straighten out the library books he saw them shaking rugs in the methodist graveyard i can never look a methodist in the face again just think what a scandal it will make  a scandal it assuredly did make growing more scandalous as it spread until the over harbour people heard that the manse children had not only cleaned house and put out a washing on sunday but had wound up with an afternoon picnic in the graveyard while the methodist sunday school was going on the only household which remained in blissful ignorance of the terrible thing was the manse itself on what faith and una fondly believed to be tuesday it rained again for the next three days it rained nobody came near the manse the manse folk went nowhere they might have waded through the misty rainbow valley up to ingleside but all the blythe family save susan and the doctor were away on a visit to avonlea  this is the last of our bread said faith and the ditto is done if aunt martha doesnt get better soon what will we do  we can buy some bread in the village and theres the codfish mary dried said una but we dont know how to cook it  oh thats easy laughed faith you just boil it  boil it they did but as it did not occur to them to soak it beforehand it was too salty to eat that night they were very hungry but by the following day their troubles were over sunshine returned to the world carl was well and aunt marthas misery left her as suddenly as it had come the butcher called at the manse and chased famine away to crown all the blythes returned home and that evening they and the manse children and mary vance kept sunset tryst once more in rainbow valley where the daisies were floating upon the grass like spirits of the dew and the bells on the tree lovers rang like fairy chimes in the scented twilight     chapter xi a dreadful discovery   well you kids have gone and done it now was marys greeting as she joined them in the valley miss cornelia was up at ingleside holding agonized conclave with anne and susan and mary hoped that the session might be a long one for it was all of two weeks since she had been allowed to revel with her chums in the dear valley of rainbows  done what demanded everybody but walter who was day dreaming as usual  its you manse young ones i mean said mary it was just awful of you i wouldnt have done such a thing for the world and i werent brought up in a manse werent brought up anywhere just come up  what have we done asked faith blankly  done youd better ask the talk is something terrible i expect its ruined your father in this congregation hell never be able to live it down poor man everybody blames him for it and that isnt fair but nothing is fair in this world you ought to be ashamed of yourselves  what have we done asked una again despairingly faith said nothing but her eyes flashed golden brown scorn at mary  oh dont pretend innocence said mary witheringly everybody knows what you have done  i dont interjected jem blythe indignantly dont let me catch you making una cry mary vance what are you talking about  i spose you dont know since youre just back from up west said mary somewhat subdued jem could always manage her but everybody else knows youd better believe  knows what  that faith and una stayed home from sunday school last sunday and cleaned house  we didnt cried faith and una in passionate denial  mary looked haughtily at them  i didnt suppose youd deny it after the way youve combed me down for lying she said whats the good of saying you didnt everybody knows you did elder clow and his wife saw you some people say it will break up the church but i dont go that far you are nice ones  nan blythe stood up and put her arms around the dazed faith and una  they were nice enough to take you in and feed you and clothe you when you were starving in mr taylors barn mary vance she said you are very grateful i must say  i am grateful retorted mary youd know it if youd heard me standing up for mr meredith through thick and thin ive blistered my tongue talking for him this week ive said again and again that he isnt to blame if his young ones did clean house on sunday he was away and they knew better  but we didnt protested una it was monday we cleaned house wasnt it faith  of course it was said faith with flashing eyes we went to sunday school in spite of the rain and no one came not even elder abraham for all his talk about fair weather christians  it was saturday it rained said mary sunday was as fine as silk i wasnt at sunday school because i had toothache but every one else was and they saw all your stuff out on the lawn and elder abraham and mrs elder abraham saw you shaking rugs in the graveyard  una sat down among the daisies and began to cry  look here said jem resolutely this thing must be cleared up somebody has made a mistake sunday was fine faith how could you have thought saturday was sunday  prayer meeting was thursday night cried faith and adam flew into the soup pot on friday when aunt marthas cat chased him and spoiled our dinner and saturday there was a snake in the cellar and carl caught it with a forked stick and carried it out and sunday it rained so there  prayer meeting was wednesday night said mary elder baxter was to lead and he couldnt go thursday night and it was changed to wednesday you were just a day out faith meredith and you did work on sunday  suddenly faith burst into a peal of laughter  i suppose we did what a joke  it isnt much of a joke for your father said mary sourly  itll be all right when people find out it was just a mistake said faith carelessly well explain  you can explain till youre black in the face said mary but a lie like thatll travel fastern further than you ever will ive seen more of the world than you and i know besides there are plenty of folks wont believe it was a mistake  they will if i tell them said faith  you cant tell everybody said mary no i tell you youve disgraced your father  unas evening was spoiled by this dire reflection but faith refused to be made uncomfortable besides she had a plan that would put everything right so she put the past with its mistake behind her and gave herself over to enjoyment of the present jem went away to fish and walter came out of his reverie and proceeded to describe the woods of heaven mary pricked up her ears and listened respectfully despite her awe of walter she revelled in his book talk it always gave her a delightful sensation walter had been reading his coleridge that day and he pictured a heaven where  there were gardens bright with sinuous rills where blossomed many an incense bearing tree and there were forests ancient as the hills enfolding sunny spots of greenery  i didnt know there was any woods in heaven said mary with a long breath i thought it was all streets and streets and streets  of course there are woods said nan mother cant live without trees and i cant so what would be the use of going to heaven if there werent any trees  there are cities too said the young dreamer splendid cities coloured just like the sunset with sapphire towers and rainbow domes they are built of gold and diamonds whole streets of diamonds flashing like the sun in the squares there are crystal fountains kissed by the light and everywhere the asphodel blooms the flower of heaven  fancy said mary i saw the main street in charlottetown once and i thought it was real grand but i spose its nothing to heaven well it all sounds gorgeous the way you tell it but wont it be kind of dull too  oh i guess we can have some fun when the angels backs are turned said faith comfortably  heaven is all fun declared di  the bible doesnt say so cried mary who had read so much of the bible on sunday afternoons under miss cornelias eye that she now considered herself quite an authority on it  mother says the bible language is figurative said nan  does that mean that it isnt true asked mary hopefully  no not exactly but i think it means that heaven will be just like what youd like it to be  id like it to be just like rainbow valley said mary with all you kids to gas and play with thats good enough for me anyhow we cant go to heaven till were dead and maybe not then so whats the use of worrying heres jem with a string of trout and its my turn to fry them  we ought to know more about heaven than walter does when were the ministers family said una as they walked home that night  we know just as much but walter can imagine said faith mrs elliott says he gets it from his mother  i do wish we hadnt made that mistake about sunday sighed una  dont worry over that ive thought of a great plan to explain so that everybody will know said faith just wait till to morrow night     chapter xii an explanation and a dare   the rev dr cooper preached in glen st mary the next evening and the presbyterian church was crowded with people from near and far the reverend doctor was reputed to be a very eloquent speaker and bearing in mind the old dictum that a minister should take his best clothes to the city and his best sermons to the country he delivered a very scholarly and impressive discourse but when the folks went home that night it was not of dr coopers sermon they talked they had completely forgotten all about it  dr cooper had concluded with a fervent appeal had wiped the perspiration from his massive brow had said let us pray as he was famed for saying it and had duly prayed there was a slight pause in glen st mary church the old fashion of taking the collection after the sermon instead of before still held mainly because the methodists had adopted the new fashion first and miss cornelia and elder clow would not hear of following where methodists had led charles baxter and thomas douglas whose duty it was to pass the plates were on the point of rising to their feet the organist had got out the music of her anthem and the choir had cleared its throat suddenly faith meredith rose in the manse pew walked up to the pulpit platform and faced the amazed audience  miss cornelia half rose in her seat and then sat down again her pew was far back and it occurred to her that whatever faith meant to do or say would be half done or said before she could reach her there was no use making the exhibition worse than it had to be with an anguished glance at mrs dr blythe and another at deacon warren of the methodist church miss cornelia resigned herself to another scandal  if the child was only dressed decently itself she groaned in spirit  faith having spilled ink on her good dress had serenely put on an old one of faded pink print a caticornered rent in the skirt had been darned with scarlet tracing cotton and the hem had been let down showing a bright strip of unfaded pink around the skirt but faith was not thinking of her clothes at all she was feeling suddenly nervous what had seemed easy in imagination was rather hard in reality confronted by all those staring questioning eyes faiths courage almost failed her the lights were so bright the silence so awesome she thought she could not speak after all but she must her father must be cleared of suspicion only the words would not come  unas little pearl pure face gleamed up at her beseechingly from the manse pew the blythe children were lost in amazement back under the gallery faith saw the sweet graciousness of miss rosemary wests smile and the amusement of miss ellens but none of these helped her it was bertie shakespeare drew who saved the situation bertie shakespeare sat in the front seat of the gallery and he made a derisive face at faith faith promptly made a dreadful one back at him and in her anger over being grimaced at by bertie shakespeare forgot her stage fright she found her voice and spoke out clearly and bravely  i want to explain something she said and i want to do it now because everybody will hear it that heard the other people are saying that una and i stayed home last sunday and cleaned house instead of going to sunday school well we did but we didnt mean to we got mixed up in the days of the week it was all elder baxters fault sensation in baxters pew because he went and changed the prayer meeting to wednesday night and then we thought thursday was friday and so on till we thought saturday was sunday carl was laid up sick and so was aunt martha so they couldnt put us right we went to sunday school in all that rain on saturday and nobody came and then we thought wed clean house on monday and stop old cats from talking about how dirty the manse was general sensation all over the church and we did i shook the rugs in the methodist graveyard because it was such a convenient place and not because i meant to be disrespectful of the dead it isnt the dead folks who have made the fuss over this its the living folks and it isnt right for any of you to blame my father for this because he was away and didnt know and anyhow we thought it was monday hes just the best father that ever lived in the world and we love him with all our hearts  faiths bravado ebbed out in a sob she ran down the steps and flashed out of the side door of the church there the friendly starlit summer night comforted her and the ache went out of her eyes and throat she felt very happy the dreadful explanation was over and everybody knew now that her father wasnt to blame and that she and una were not so wicked as to have cleaned house knowingly on sunday  inside the church people gazed blankly at each other but thomas douglas rose and walked up the aisle with a set face his duty was clear the collection must be taken if the skies fell taken it was the choir sang the anthem with a dismal conviction that it fell terribly flat and dr cooper gave out the concluding hymn and pronounced the benediction with considerably less unction than usual the reverend doctor had a sense of humour and faiths performance tickled him besides john meredith was well known in presbyterian circles  mr meredith returned home the next afternoon but before his coming faith contrived to scandalize glen st mary again in the reaction from sunday evenings intensity and strain she was especially full of what miss cornelia would have called devilment on monday this led her to dare walter blythe to ride through main street on a pig while she rode another one  the pigs in question were two tall lank animals supposed to belong to bertie shakespeare drews father which had been haunting the roadside by the manse for a couple of weeks walter did not want to ride a pig through glen st mary but whatever faith meredith dared him to do must be done they tore down the hill and through the village faith bent double with laughter over her terrified courser walter crimson with shame they tore past the minister himself just coming home from the station he being a little less dreamy and abstracted than usual owing to having had a talk on the train with miss cornelia who always wakened him up temporarily noticed them and thought he really must speak to faith about it and tell her that such conduct was not seemly but he had forgotten the trifling incident by the time he reached home they passed mrs alec davis who shrieked in horror and they passed miss rosemary west who laughed and sighed finally just before the pigs swooped into bertie shakespeare drews back yard never to emerge therefrom again so great had been the shock to their nerves faith and walter jumped off as dr and mrs blythe drove swiftly by  so that is how you bring up your boys said gilbert with mock severity  perhaps i do spoil them a little said anne contritely but oh gilbert when i think of my own childhood before i came to green gables i havent the heart to be very strict how hungry for love and fun i was an unloved little drudge with never a chance to play they do have such good times with the manse children  what about the poor pigs asked gilbert  anne tried to look sober and failed  do you really think it hurt them she said i dont think anything could hurt those animals theyve been the plague of the neighbourhood this summer and the drews wont shut them up but ill talk to walter if i can keep from laughing when i do it  miss cornelia came up to ingleside that evening to relieve her feelings over sunday night to her surprise she found that anne did not view faiths performance in quite the same light as she did  i thought there was something brave and pathetic in her getting up there before that churchful of people to confess she said you could see she was frightened to death yet she was bound to clear her father i loved her for it  oh of course the poor child meant well sighed miss cornelia but just the same it was a terrible thing to do and is making more talk than the house cleaning on sunday that had begun to die away and this has started it all up again rosemary west is like you she said last night as she left the church that it was a plucky thing for faith to do but it made her feel sorry for the child too miss ellen thought it all a good joke and said she hadnt had as much fun in church for years of course they dont care they are episcopalians but we presbyterians feel it and there were so many hotel people there that night and scores of methodists mrs leander crawford cried she felt so bad and mrs alec davis said the little hussy ought to be spanked  mrs leander crawford is always crying in church said susan contemptuously she cries over every affecting thing the minister says but you do not often see her name on a subscription list mrs dr dear tears come cheaper she tried to talk to me one day about aunt martha being such a dirty housekeeper and i wanted to say ‘every one knows that you have been seen mixing up cakes in the kitchen wash pan mrs leander crawford but i did not say it mrs dr dear because i have too much respect for myself to condescend to argue with the likes of her but i could tell worse things than that of mrs leander crawford if i was disposed to gossip and as for mrs alec davis if she had said that to me mrs dr dear do you know what i would have said i would have said ‘i have no doubt you would like to spank faith mrs davis but you will never have the chance to spank a ministers daughter either in this world or in that which is to come  if poor faith had only been decently dressed lamented miss cornelia again it wouldnt have been quite that bad but that dress looked dreadful as she stood there upon the platform  it was clean though mrs dr dear said susan they are clean children they may be very heedless and reckless mrs dr dear and i am not saying they are not but they never forget to wash behind their ears  the idea of faith forgetting what day was sunday persisted miss cornelia she will grow up just as careless and impractical as her father believe me i suppose carl would have known better if he hadnt been sick i dont know what was wrong with him but i think it very likely he had been eating those blueberries that grew in the graveyard no wonder they made him sick if i was a methodist id try to keep my graveyard cleaned up at least  i am of the opinion that carl only ate the sours that grow on the dyke said susan hopefully i do not think any ministers son would eat blueberries that grew on the graves of dead people you know it would not be so bad mrs dr dear to eat things that grew on the dyke  the worst of last nights performance was the face faith made made at somebody in the congregation before she started in said miss cornelia elder clow declares she made it at him and did you hear that she was seen riding on a pig to day  i saw her walter was with her i gave him a little a very little scolding about it he did not say much but he gave me the impression that it had been his idea and that faith was not to blame  i do not not believe that mrs dr dear cried susan up in arms that is just walters way to take the blame on himself but you know as well as i do mrs dr dear that that blessed child would never have thought of riding on a pig even if he does write poetry  oh theres no doubt the notion was hatched in faith merediths brain said miss cornelia and i dont say that im sorry that amos drews old pigs did get their come uppance for once but the ministers daughter  and the doctors son said anne mimicking miss cornelias tone then she laughed dear miss cornelia theyre only little children and you know theyve never yet done anything bad theyre just heedless and impulsive as i was myself once theyll grow sedate and sober as ive done  miss cornelia laughed too  there are times anne dearie when i know by your eyes that your soberness is put on like a garment and youre really aching to do something wild and young again well i feel encouraged somehow a talk with you always does have that effect on me now when i go to see barbara samson its just the opposite she makes me feel that everythings wrong and always will be but of course living all your life with a man like joe samson wouldnt be exactly cheering  it is a very strange thing to think that she married joe samson after all her chances remarked susan she was much sought after when she was a girl she used to boast to me that she had twenty one beaus and mr pethick  what was mr pethick  well he was a sort of hanger on mrs dr dear but you could not exactly call him a beau he did not really have any intentions twenty one beaus and me that never had one but barbara went through the woods and picked up the crooked stick after all and yet they say her husband can make better baking powder biscuits than she can and she always gets him to make them when company comes to tea  which reminds me that i have company coming to tea to morrow and i must go home and set my bread said miss cornelia mary said she could set it and no doubt she could but while i live and move and have my being i set my own bread believe me  how is mary getting on asked anne  ive no fault to find with mary said miss cornelia rather gloomily shes getting some flesh on her bones and shes clean and respectful though theres more in her than i can fathom shes a sly puss if you dug for a thousand years you couldnt get to the bottom of that childs mind believe me as for work i never saw anything like her she eats it up mrs wiley may have been cruel to her but folks neednt say she made mary work marys a born worker sometimes i wonder which will wear out first her legs or her tongue i dont have enough to do to keep me out of mischief these days ill be real glad when school opens for then ill have something to do again mary doesnt want to go to school but i put my foot down and said that go she must i shall not have the methodists saying that i kept her out of school while i lolled in idleness     chapter xiii the house on the hill   there was a little unfailing spring always icy cold and crystal pure in a certain birch screened hollow of rainbow valley in the lower corner near the marsh not a great many people knew of its existence the manse and ingleside children knew of course as they knew everything else about the magic valley occasionally they went there to get a drink and it figured in many of their plays as a fountain of old romance anne knew of it and loved it because it somehow reminded her of the beloved dryads bubble at green gables rosemary west knew of it it was her fountain of romance too eighteen years ago she had sat behind it one spring twilight and heard young martin crawford stammer out a confession of fervent boyish love she had whispered her own secret in return and they had kissed and promised by the wild wood spring they had never stood together by it again martin had sailed on his fatal voyage soon after but to rosemary west it was always a sacred spot hallowed by that immortal hour of youth and love whenever she passed near it she turned aside to hold a secret tryst with an old dream a dream from which the pain had long gone leaving only its unforgettable sweetness  the spring was a hidden thing you might have passed within ten feet of it and never have suspected its existence two generations past a huge old pine had fallen almost across it nothing was left of the tree but its crumbling trunk out of which the ferns grew thickly making a green roof and a lacy screen for the water a maple tree grew beside it with a curiously gnarled and twisted trunk creeping along the ground for a little way before shooting up into the air and so forming a quaint seat and september had flung a scarf of pale smoke blue asters around the hollow  john meredith taking the cross lots road through rainbow valley on his way home from some pastoral visitations around the harbour head one evening turned aside to drink of the little spring walter blythe had shown it to him one afternoon only a few days before and they had had a long talk together on the maple seat john meredith under all his shyness and aloofness had the heart of a boy he had been called jack in his youth though nobody in glen st mary would ever have believed it walter and he had taken to each other and had talked unreservedly mr meredith found his way into some sealed and sacred chambers of the lads soul wherein not even di had ever looked they were to be chums from that friendly hour and walter knew that he would never be frightened of the minister again  i never believed before that it was possible to get really acquainted with a minister he told his mother that night  john meredith drank from his slender white hand whose grip of steel always surprised people who were unacquainted with it and then sat down on the maple seat he was in no hurry to go home this was a beautiful spot and he was mentally weary after a round of rather uninspiring conversations with many good and stupid people the moon was rising rainbow valley was wind haunted and star sentinelled only where he was but afar from the upper end came the gay notes of childrens laughter and voices  the ethereal beauty of the asters in the moonlight the glimmer of the little spring the soft croon of the brook the wavering grace of the brackens all wove a white magic round john meredith he forgot congregational worries and spiritual problems the years slipped away from him he was a young divinity student again and the roses of june were blooming red and fragrant on the dark queenly head of his cecilia he sat there and dreamed like any boy and it was at this propitious moment that rosemary west stepped aside from the by path and stood beside him in that dangerous spell weaving place john meredith stood up as she came in and saw her really saw her for the first time  he had met her in his church once or twice and shaken hands with her abstractedly as he did with anyone he happened to encounter on his way down the aisle he had never met her elsewhere for the wests were episcopalians with church affinities in lowbridge and no occasion for calling upon them had ever arisen before to night if anyone had asked john meredith what rosemary west looked like he would not have had the slightest notion but he was never to forget her as she appeared to him in the glamour of kind moonlight by the spring  she was certainly not in the least like cecilia who had always been his ideal of womanly beauty cecilia had been small and dark and vivacious rosemary west was tall and fair and placid yet john meredith thought he had never seen so beautiful a woman  she was bareheaded and her golden hair hair of a warm gold molasses taffy colour as di blythe had said was pinned in sleek close coils over her head she had large tranquil blue eyes that always seemed full of friendliness a high white forehead and a finely shaped face  rosemary west was always called a sweet woman she was so sweet that even her high bred stately air had never gained for her the reputation of being stuck up which it would inevitably have done in the case of anyone else in glen st mary life had taught her to be brave to be patient to love to forgive she had watched the ship on which her lover went sailing out of four winds harbour into the sunset but though she watched long she had never seen it coming sailing back that vigil had taken girlhood from her eyes yet she kept her youth to a marvellous degree perhaps this was because she always seemed to preserve that attitude of delighted surprise towards life which most of us leave behind in childhood an attitude which not only made rosemary herself seem young but flung a pleasing illusion of youth over the consciousness of every one who talked to her  john meredith was startled by her loveliness and rosemary was startled by his presence she had never thought she would find anyone by that remote spring least of all the recluse of glen st mary manse she almost dropped the heavy armful of books she was carrying home from the glen lending library and then to cover her confusion she told one of those small fibs which even the best of women do tell at times  i i came for a drink she said stammering a little in answer to mr merediths grave good evening miss west she felt that she was an unpardonable goose and she longed to shake herself but john meredith was not a vain man and he knew she would likely have been as much startled had she met old elder clow in that unexpected fashion her confusion put him at ease and he forgot to be shy besides even the shyest of men can sometimes be quite audacious in moonlight  let me get you a cup he said smiling there was a cup near by if he had only known it a cracked handleless blue cup secreted under the maple by the rainbow valley children but he did not know it so he stepped out to one of the birch trees and stripped a bit of its white skin away deftly he fashioned this into a three cornered cup filled it from the spring and handed it to rosemary  rosemary took it and drank every drop to punish herself for her fib for she was not in the least thirsty and to drink a fairly large cupful of water when you are not thirsty is somewhat of an ordeal yet the memory of that draught was to be very pleasant to rosemary in after years it seemed to her that there was something sacramental about it perhaps this was because of what the minister did when she handed him back the cup he stooped again and filled it and drank of it himself it was only by accident that he put his lips just where rosemary had put hers and rosemary knew it nevertheless it had a curious significance for her they two had drunk of the same cup she remembered idly that an old aunt of hers used to say that when two people did this their after lives would be linked in some fashion whether for good or ill  john meredith held the cup uncertainly he did not know what to do with it the logical thing would have been to toss it away but somehow he was disinclined to do this rosemary held out her hand for it  will you let me have it she said you made it so knackily i never saw anyone make a birch cup so since my little brother used to make them long ago before he died  i learned how to make them when i was a boy camping out one summer an old hunter taught me said mr meredith let me carry your books miss west  rosemary was startled into another fib and said oh they were not heavy but the minister took them from her with quite a masterful air and they walked away together it was the first time rosemary had stood by the valley spring without thinking of martin crawford the mystic tryst had been broken  the little by path wound around the marsh and then struck up the long wooded hill on the top of which rosemary lived beyond through the trees they could see the moonlight shining across the level summer fields but the little path was shadowy and narrow trees crowded over it and trees are never quite as friendly to human beings after nightfall as they are in daylight they wrap themselves away from us they whisper and plot furtively if they reach out a hand to us it has a hostile tentative touch people walking amid trees after night always draw closer together instinctively and involuntarily making an alliance physical and mental against certain alien powers around them rosemarys dress brushed against john meredith as they walked not even an absent minded minister who was after all a young man still though he firmly believed he had outlived romance could be insensible to the charm of the night and the path and the companion  it is never quite safe to think we have done with life when we imagine we have finished our story fate has a trick of turning the page and showing us yet another chapter these two people each thought their hearts belonged irrevocably to the past but they both found their walk up that hill very pleasant rosemary thought the glen minister was by no means as shy and tongue tied as he had been represented he seemed to find no difficulty in talking easily and freely glen housewives would have been amazed had they heard him but then so many glen housewives talked only gossip and the price of eggs and john meredith was not interested in either he talked to rosemary of books and music and wide world doings and something of his own history and found that she could understand and respond rosemary it appeared possessed a book which mr meredith had not read and wished to read she offered to lend it to him and when they reached the old homestead on the hill he went in to get it  the house itself was an old fashioned gray one hung with vines through which the light in the sitting room winked in friendly fashion it looked down the glen over the harbour silvered in the moonlight to the sand dunes and the moaning ocean they walked in through a garden that always seemed to smell of roses even when no roses were in bloom there was a sisterhood of lilies at the gate and a ribbon of asters on either side of the broad walk and a lacery of fir trees on the hills edge beyond the house  you have the whole world at your doorstep here said john meredith with a long breath what a view what an outlook at times i feel stifled down there in the glen you can breathe up here  it is calm to night said rosemary laughing if there were a wind it would blow your breath away we get ‘a the airts the wind can blow up here this place should be called four winds instead of the harbour  i like wind he said a day when there is no wind seems to me dead a windy day wakes me up he gave a conscious laugh on a calm day i fall into day dreams no doubt you know my reputation miss west if i cut you dead the next time we meet dont put it down to bad manners please understand that it is only abstraction and forgive me and speak to me  they found ellen west in the sitting room when they went in she laid her glasses down on the book she had been reading and looked at them in amazement tinctured with something else but she shook hands amiably with mr meredith and he sat down and talked to her while rosemary hunted out his book  ellen west was ten years older than rosemary and so different from her that it was hard to believe they were sisters she was dark and massive with black hair thick black eyebrows and eyes of the clear slaty blue of the gulf water in a north wind she had a rather stern forbidding look but she was in reality very jolly with a hearty gurgling laugh and a deep mellow pleasant voice with a suggestion of masculinity about it she had once remarked to rosemary that she would really like to have a talk with that presbyterian minister at the glen to see if he could find a word to say to a woman when he was cornered she had her chance now and she tackled him on world politics miss ellen who was a great reader had been devouring a book on the kaiser of germany and she demanded mr merediths opinion of him  a dangerous man was his answer  i believe you miss ellen nodded mark my words mr meredith that man is going to fight somebody yet hes aching to he is going to set the world on fire  if you mean that he will wantonly precipitate a great war i hardly think so said mr meredith the day has gone by for that sort of thing  bless you it hasnt rumbled ellen the day never goes by for men and nations to make asses of themselves and take to the fists the millenniun isnt that near mr meredith and you dont think it is any more than i do as for this kaiser mark my words he is going to make a heap of trouble and miss ellen prodded her book emphatically with her long finger yes if he isnt nipped in the bud hes going to make trouble well live to see it you and i will live to see it mr meredith and who is going to nip him england should but she wont who is going to nip him tell me that mr meredith  mr meredith couldnt tell her but they plunged into a discussion of german militarism that lasted long after rosemary had found the book rosemary said nothing but sat in a little rocker behind ellen and stroked an important black cat meditatively john meredith hunted big game in europe with ellen but he looked oftener at rosemary than at ellen and ellen noticed it after rosemary had gone to the door with him and come back ellen rose and looked at her accusingly  rosemary west that man has a notion of courting you  rosemary quivered ellens speech was like a blow to her it rubbed all the bloom off the pleasant evening but she would not let ellen see how it hurt her  nonsense she said and laughed a little too carelessly you see a beau for me in every bush ellen why he told me all about his wife to night how much she was to him how empty her death had left the world  well that may be his way of courting retorted ellen men have all kinds of ways i understand but dont forget your promise rosemary  there is no need of my either forgetting or remembering it said rosemary a little wearily you forget that im an old maid ellen it is only your sisterly delusion that i am still young and blooming and dangerous mr meredith merely wants to be a friend if he wants that much itself hell forget us both long before he gets back to the manse  ive no objection to your being friends with him conceded ellen but it musnt go beyond friendship remember im always suspicious of widowers they are not given to romantic ideas about friendship theyre apt to mean business as for this presbyterian man what do they call him shy for hes not a bit shy though he may be absent minded so absent minded that he forgot to say goodnight to me when you started to go to the door with him hes got brains too theres so few men round here that can talk sense to a body ive enjoyed the evening i wouldnt mind seeing more of him but no philandering rosemary mind you no philandering  rosemary was quite used to being warned by ellen from philandering if she so much as talked five minutes to any marriageable man under eighty or over eighteen she had always laughed at the warning with unfeigned amusement this time it did not amuse her it irritated her a little who wanted to philander  dont be such a goose ellen she said with unaccustomed shortness as she took her lamp she went upstairs without saying goodnight  ellen shook her head dubiously and looked at the black cat  what is she so cross about st george she asked when you howl youre hit ive always heard george but she promised saint she promised and we wests always keep our word so it wont matter if he does want to philander george she promised i wont worry  upstairs in her room rosemary sat for a long while looking out of the window across the moonlit garden to the distant shining harbour she felt vaguely upset and unsettled she was suddenly tired of outworn dreams and in the garden the petals of the last red rose were scattered by a sudden little wind summer was over it was autumn     chapter xiv mrs alec davis makes a call   john meredith walked slowly home at first he thought a little about rosemary but by the time he reached rainbow valley he had forgotten all about her and was meditating on a point regarding german theology which ellen had raised he passed through rainbow valley and knew it not the charm of rainbow valley had no potency against german theology when he reached the manse he went to his study and took down a bulky volume in order to see which had been right he or ellen he remained immersed in its mazes until dawn struck a new trail of speculation and pursued it like a sleuth hound for the next week utterly lost to the world his parish and his family he read day and night he forgot to go to his meals when una was not there to drag him to them he never thought about rosemary or ellen again old mrs marshall over harbour was very ill and sent for him but the message lay unheeded on his desk and gathered dust mrs marshall recovered but never forgave him a young couple came to the manse to be married and mr meredith with unbrushed hair in carpet slippers and faded dressing gown married them to be sure he began by reading the funeral service to them and got along as far as ashes to ashes and dust to dust before he vaguely suspected that something was wrong  dear me he said absently that is strange very strange  the bride who was very nervous began to cry the bridegroom who was not in the least nervous giggled  please sir i think youre burying us instead of marrying us he said  excuse me said mr meredith as it it did not matter much he turned up the marriage service and got through with it but the bride never felt quite properly married for the rest of her life  he forgot his prayer meeting again but that did not matter for it was a wet night and nobody came he might even have forgotten his sunday service if it had not been for mrs alec davis aunt martha came in on saturday afternoon and told him that mrs davis was in the parlour and wanted to see him mr meredith sighed mrs davis was the only woman in glen st mary church whom he positively detested unfortunately she was also the richest and his board of managers had warned mr meredith against offending her mr meredith seldom thought of such a worldly matter as his stipend but the managers were more practical also they were astute without mentioning money they contrived to instil into mr merediths mind a conviction that he should not offend mrs davis otherwise he would likely have forgotten all about her as soon as aunt martha had gone out as it was he turned down his ewald with a feeling of annoyance and went across the hall to the parlour  mrs davis was sitting on the sofa looking about her with an air of scornful disapproval  what a scandalous room there were no curtains on the window mrs davis did not know that faith and una had taken them down the day before to use as court trains in one of their plays and had forgotten to put them up again but she could not have accused those windows more fiercely if she had known the blinds were cracked and torn the pictures on the walls were crooked the rugs were awry the vases were full of faded flowers the dust lay in heaps literally in heaps  what are we coming to mrs davis asked herself and then primmed up her unbeautiful mouth  jerry and carl had been whooping and sliding down the banisters as she came through the hall they did not see her and continued whooping and sliding and mrs davis was convinced they did it on purpose faiths pet rooster ambled through the hall stood in the parlour doorway and looked at her not liking her looks he did not venture in mrs davis gave a scornful sniff a pretty manse indeed where roosters paraded the halls and stared people out of countenance  shoo there commanded mrs davis poking her flounced changeable silk parasol at him  adam shooed he was a wise rooster and mrs davis had wrung the necks of so many roosters with her own fair hands in the course of her fifty years that an air of the executioner seemed to hang around her adam scuttled through the hall as the minister came in  mr meredith still wore slippers and dressing gown and his dark hair still fell in uncared for locks over his high brow but he looked the gentleman he was and mrs alec davis in her silk dress and beplumed bonnet and kid gloves and gold chain looked the vulgar coarse souled woman she was each felt the antagonisn of the others personality mr meredith shrank but mrs davis girded up her loins for the fray she had come to the manse to propose a certain thing to the minister and she meant to lose no time in proposing it she was going to do him a favour a great favour and the sooner he was made aware of it the better she had been thinking about it all summer and had come to a decision at last this was all that mattered mrs davis thought when she decided a thing it was decided nobody else had any say in the matter that had always been her attitude when she had made her mind up to marry alec davis she had married him and that was the end to it alec had never known how it happened but what odds so in this case mrs davis had arranged everything to her own satisfaction now it only remained to inform mr meredith  will you please shut that door said mrs davis unprimming her mouth slightly to say it but speaking with asperity i have something important to say and i cant say it with that racket in the hall  mr meredith shut the door meekly then he sat down before mrs davis he was not wholly aware of her yet his mind was still wrestling with ewalds arguments mrs davis sensed this detachment and it annoyed her  i have come to tell you mr meredith she said aggressively that i have decided to adopt una  to adopt una mr meredith gazed at her blankly not understanding in the least  yes ive been thinking it over for some time i have often thought of adopting a child since my husbands death but it seemed so hard to get a suitable one it is very few children i would want to take into my home i wouldnt think of taking a home child some outcast of the slums in all probability and there is hardly ever any other child to be got one of the fishermen down at the harbour died last fall and left six youngsters they tried to get me to take one but i soon gave them to understand that i had no idea of adopting trash like that their grandfather stole a horse besides they were all boys and i wanted a girl a quiet obedient girl that i could train up to be a lady una will suit me exactly she would be a nice little thing if she was properly looked after so different from faith i would never dream of adopting faith but ill take una and ill give her a good home and up bringing mr meredith and if she behaves herself ill leave her all my money when i die not one of my own relatives shall have a cent of it in any case im determined on that it was the idea of aggravating them that set me to thinking of adopting a child as much as anything in the first place una shall be well dressed and educated and trained mr meredith and i shall give her music and painting lessons and treat her as if she was my own  mr meredith was wide enough awake by this time there was a faint flush in his pale cheek and a dangerous light in his fine dark eyes was this woman whose vulgarity and consciousness of money oozed out of her at every pore actually asking him to give her una his dear little wistful una with cecilias own dark blue eyes the child whom the dying mother had clasped to her heart after the other children had been led weeping from the room cecilia had clung to her baby until the gates of death had shut between them she had looked over the little dark head to her husband  take good care of her john she had entreated she is so small and sensitive the others can fight their way but the world will hurt her oh john i dont know what you and she are going to do you both need me so much but keep her close to you keep her close to you  these had been almost her last words except a few unforgettable ones for him alone and it was this child whom mrs davis had coolly announced her intention of taking from him he sat up straight and looked at mrs davis in spite of the worn dressing gown and the frayed slippers there was something about him that made mrs davis feel a little of the old reverence for the cloth in which she had been brought up after all there was a certain divinity hedging a minister even a poor unworldly abstracted one  i thank you for your kind intentions mrs davis said mr meredith with a gentle final quite awful courtesy but i cannot give you my child  mrs davis looked blank she had never dreamed of his refusing  why mr meredith she said in astonishment you must be cr you cant mean it you must think it over think of all the advantages i can give her  there is no need to think it over mrs davis it is entirely out of the question all the worldly advantages it is in your power to bestow on her could not compensate for the loss of a fathers love and care i thank you again but it is not to be thought of  disappointment angered mrs davis beyond the power of old habit to control her broad red face turned purple and her voice trembled  i thought youd be only too glad to let me have her she sneered  why did you think that asked mr meredith quietly  because nobody ever supposed you cared anything about any of your children retorted mrs davis contemptuously you neglect them scandalously it is the talk of the place they arent fed and dressed properly and theyre not trained at all they have no more manners than a pack of wild indians you never think of doing your duty as a father you let a stray child come here among them for a fortnight and never took any notice of her a child that swore like a trooper im told you wouldnt have cared if theyd caught small pox from her and faith made an exhibition of herself getting up in preaching and making that speech and she rid a pig down the street under your very eyes i understand the way they act is past belief and you never lift a finger to stop them or try to teach them anything and now when i offer one of them a good home and good prospects you refuse it and insult me a pretty father you to talk of loving and caring for your children  that will do woman said mr meredith he stood up and looked at mrs davis with eyes that made her quail that will do he repeated i desire to hear no more mrs davis you have said too much it may be that i have been remiss in some respects in my duty as a parent but it is not for you to remind me of it in such terms as you have used let us say good afternoon  mrs davis did not say anything half so amiable as good afternoon but she took her departure as she swept past the minister a large plump toad which carl had secreted under the lounge hopped out almost under her feet mrs davis gave a shriek and in trying to avoid treading on the awful thing lost her balance and her parasol she did not exactly fall but she staggered and reeled across the room in a very undignified fashion and brought up against the door with a thud that jarred her from head to foot mr meredith who had not seen the toad wondered if she had been attacked with some kind of apoplectic or paralytic seizure and ran in alarm to her assistance but mrs davis recovering her feet waved him back furiously  dont you dare to touch me she almost shouted this is some more of your childrens doings i suppose this is no fit place for a decent woman give me my umbrella and let me go ill never darken the doors of your manse or your church again  mr meredith picked up the gorgeous parasol meekly enough and gave it to her mrs davis seized it and marched out jerry and carl had given up banister sliding and were sitting on the edge of the veranda with faith unfortunately all three were singing at the tops of their healthy young voices therell be a hot time in the old town to night mrs davis believed the song was meant for her and her only she stopped and shook her parasol at them  your father is a fool she said and you are three young varmints that ought to be whipped within an inch of your lives  he isnt cried faith were not cried the boys but mrs davis was gone  goodness isnt she mad said jerry and what is a ‘varmint anyhow  john meredith paced up and down the parlour for a few minutes then he went back to his study and sat down but he did not return to his german theology he was too grievously disturbed for that mrs davis had wakened him up with a vengeance was he such a remiss careless father as she had accused him of being had he so scandalously neglected the bodily and spiritual welfare of the four little motherless creatures dependent on him were his people talking of it as harshly as mrs davis had declared it must be so since mrs davis had come to ask for una in the full and confident belief that he would hand the child over to her as unconcernedly and gladly as one might hand over a strayed unwelcome kitten and if so what then  john meredith groaned and resumed his pacing up and down the dusty disordered room what could he do he loved his children as deeply as any father could and he knew past the power of mrs davis or any of her ilk to disturb his conviction that they loved him devotedly but was he fit to have charge of them he knew none better his weaknesses and limitations what was needed was a good womans presence and influence and common sense but how could that be arranged even were he able to get such a housekeeper it would cut aunt martha to the quick she believed she could still do all that was meet and necessary he could not so hurt and insult the poor old woman who had been so kind to him and his how devoted she had been to cecilia and cecilia had asked him to be very considerate of aunt martha to be sure he suddenly remembered that aunt martha had once hinted that he ought to marry again he felt she would not resent a wife as she would a housekeeper but that was out of the question he did not wish to marry he did not and could not care for anyone then what could he do it suddenly occurred to him that he would go over to ingleside and talk over his difficulties with mrs blythe mrs blythe was one of the few women he never felt shy or tongue tied with she was always so sympathetic and refreshing it might be that she could suggest some solution of his problems and even if she could not mr meredith felt that he needed a little decent human companionship after his dose of mrs davis something to take the taste of her out of his soul  he dressed hurriedly and ate his supper less abstractedly than usual it occurred to him that it was a poor meal he looked at his children they were rosy and healthy looking enough except una and she had never been very strong even when her mother was alive they were all laughing and talking certainly they seemed happy carl was especially happy because he had two most beautiful spiders crawling around his supper plate their voices were pleasant their manners did not seem bad they were considerate of and gentle to one another yet mrs davis had said their behaviour was the talk of the congregation  as mr meredith went through his gate dr blythe and mrs blythe drove past on the road that led to lowbridge the ministers face fell mrs blythe was going away there was no use in going to ingleside and he craved a little companionship more than ever as he gazed rather hopelessly over the landscape the sunset light struck on a window of the old west homestead on the hill it flared out rosily like a beacon of good hope he suddenly remembered rosemary and ellen west he thought that he would relish some of ellens pungent conversation he thought it would be pleasant to see rosemarys slow sweet smile and calm heavenly blue eyes again what did that old poem of sir philip sidneys say continual comfort in a face that just suited her and he needed comfort why not go and call he remembered that ellen had asked him to drop in sometimes and there was rosemarys book to take back he ought to take it back before he forgot he had an uneasy suspicion that there were a great many books in his library which he had borrowed at sundry times and in divers places and had forgotten to take back it was surely his duty to guard against that in this case he went back into his study got the book and plunged downward into rainbow valley     chapter xv more gossip   on the evening after mrs myra murray of the over harbour section had been buried miss cornelia and mary vance came up to ingleside there were several things concerning which miss cornelia wished to unburden her soul the funeral had to be all talked over of course susan and miss cornelia thrashed this out between them anne took no part or delight in such goulish conversations she sat a little apart and watched the autumnal flame of dahlias in the garden and the dreaming glamorous harbour of the september sunset mary vance sat beside her knitting meekly marys heart was down in the rainbow valley whence came sweet distance softened sounds of childrens laughter but her fingers were under miss cornelias eye she had to knit so many rounds of her stocking before she might go to the valley mary knit and held her tongue but used her ears  i never saw a nicer looking corpse said miss cornelia judicially myra murray was always a pretty woman she was a corey from lowbridge and the coreys were noted for their good looks  i said to the corpse as i passed it ‘poor woman i hope you are as happy as you look sighed susan she had not changed much that dress she wore was the black satin she got for her daughters wedding fourteen years ago her aunt told her then to keep it for her funeral but myra laughed and said ‘i may wear it to my funeral aunty but i will have a good time out of it first and i may say she did myra murray was not a woman to attend her own funeral before she died many a time afterwards when i saw her enjoying herself out in company i thought to myself ‘you are a handsome woman myra murray and that dress becomes you but it will likely be your shroud at last and you see my words have come true mrs marshall elliott  susan sighed again heavily she was enjoying herself hugely a funeral was really a delightful subject of conversation  i always liked to meet myra said miss cornelia she was always so gay and cheerful she made you feel better just by her handshake myra always made the best of things  that is true asserted susan her sister in law told me that when the doctor told her at last that he could do nothing for her and she would never rise from that bed again myra said quite cheerfully ‘well if that is so im thankful the preserving is all done and i will not have to face the fall house cleaning i always liked house cleaning in spring she says ‘but i always hated it in the fall i will get clear of it this year thank goodness there are people who would call that levity mrs marshall elliott and i think her sister in law was a little ashamed of it she said perhaps her sickness had made myra a little light headed but i said ‘no mrs murray do not worry over it it was just myras way of looking at the bright side  her sister luella was just the opposite said miss cornelia there was no bright side for luella there was just black and shades of gray for years she used always to be declaring she was going to die in a week or so ‘i wont be here to burden you long she would tell her family with a groan and if any of them ventured to talk about their little future plans shed groan also and say ‘ah i wont be here then when i went to see her i always agreed with her and it made her so mad that she was always quite a lot better for several days afterwards she has better health now but no more cheerfulness myra was so different she was always doing or saying something to make some one feel good perhaps the men they married had something to do with it luellas man was a tartar believe me while jim murray was decent as men go he looked heart broken to day it isnt often i feel sorry for a man at his wifes funeral but i did feel for jim murray  no wonder he looked sad he will not get a wife like myra again in a hurry said susan maybe he will not try since his children are all grown up and mirabel is able to keep house but there is no predicting what a widower may or may not do and i for one will not try  well miss myra terrible in church said miss cornelia she was such a worker nothing ever stumped her if she couldnt get over a difficulty shed get around it and if she couldnt get around it shed pretend it wasnt there and generally it wasnt ‘ill keep a stiff upper lip to my journeys end said she to me once well she has ended her journey  do you think so asked anne suddenly coming back from dreamland i cant picture her journey as being ended can you think of her sitting down and folding her hands that eager asking spirit of hers with its fine adventurous outlook no i think in death she just opened a gate and went through on on to new shining adventures  maybe maybe assented miss cornelia do you know anne dearie i never was much taken with this everlasting rest doctrine myself though i hope it isnt heresy to say so i want to bustle round in heaven the same as here and i hope therell be a celestial substitute for pies and doughnuts something that has to be made of course one does get awful tired at times and the older you are the tireder you get but the very tiredest could get rested in something short of eternity youd think except perhaps a lazy man  when i meet myra murray again said anne i want to see her coming towards me brisk and laughing just as she always did here  oh mrs dr dear said susan in a shocked tone you surely do not think that myra will be laughing in the world to come  why not susan do you think we will be crying there  no no mrs dr dear do not misunderstand me i do not think we shall be either crying or laughing  what then  well said susan driven to it it is my opinion mrs dr dear that we shall just look solemn and holy  and do you really think susan said anne looking solemn enough that either myra murray or i could look solemn and holy all the time all the time susan  well admitted susan reluctantly i might go so far as to say that you both would have to smile now and again but i can never admit that there will be laughing in heaven the idea seems really irreverent mrs dr dear  well to come back to earth said miss cornelia who can we get to take myras class in sunday school julia clow has been teaching it since myra took ill but shes going to town for the winter and well have to get somebody else  i heard that mrs laurie jamieson wanted it said anne the jamiesons have come to church very regularly since they moved to the glen from lowbridge  new brooms said miss cornelia dubiously wait till theyve gone regularly for a year  you cannot depend on mrs jamieson a bit mrs dr dear said susan solemnly she died once and when they were measuring her for her coffin after laying her out just beautiful did she not go and come back to life now mrs dr dear you know you cannot depend on a woman like that  she might turn methodist at any moment said miss cornelia they tell me they went to the methodist church at lowbridge quite as often as to the presbyterian i havent caught them at it here yet but i would not approve of taking mrs jamieson into the sunday school yet we must not offend them we are losing too many people by death or bad temper mrs alec davis has left the church no one knows why she told the managers that she would never pay another cent to mr merediths salary of course most people say that the children offended her but somehow i dont think so i tried to pump faith but all i could get out of her was that mrs davis had come seemingly in high good humour to see her father and had left in an awful rage calling them all ‘varmints  varmints indeed said susan furiously does mrs alec davis forget that her uncle on her mothers side was suspected of poisoning his wife not that it was ever proved mrs dr dear and it does not do to believe all you hear but if i had an uncle whose wife died without any satisfactory reason i would not go about the country calling innocent children varmints  the point is said miss cornelia that mrs davis paid a large subscription and how its loss is going to be made up is a problem and if she turns the other douglases against mr meredith as she will certainly try to do he will just have to go  i do not think mrs alec davis is very well liked by the rest of the clan said susan it is not likely she will be able to influence them  but those douglases all hang together so if you touch one you touch all we cant do without them so much is certain they pay half the salary they are not mean whatever else may be said of them norman douglas used to give a hundred a year long ago before he left  what did he leave for asked anne  he declared a member of the session cheated him in a cow deal he hasnt come to church for twenty years his wife used to come regular while she was alive poor thing but he never would let her pay anything except one red cent every sunday she felt dreadfully humiliated i dont know that he was any too good a husband to her though she was never heard to complain but she always had a cowed look norman douglas didnt get the woman he wanted thirty years ago and the douglases never liked to put up with second best  who was the woman he did want  ellen west they werent engaged exactly i believe but they went about together for two years and then they just broke off nobody ever knew why just some silly quarrel i suppose and norman went and married hester reese before his temper had time to cool married her just to spite ellen i havent a doubt so like a man hester was a nice little thing but she never had much spirit and he broke what little she had she was too meek for norman he needed a woman who could stand up to him ellen would have kept him in fine order and he would have liked her all the better for it he despised hester that is the truth just because she always gave in to him i used to hear him say many a time long ago when he was a young fellow ‘give me a spunky woman spunk for me every time and then he went and married a girl who couldnt say boo to a goose man like that family of reeses were just vegetables they went through the motions of living but they didnt live  russell reese used his first wifes wedding ring to marry his second said susan reminiscently that was too economical in my opinion mrs dr dear and his brother john has his own tombstone put up in the over harbour graveyard with everything on it but the date of death and he goes and looks at it every sunday most folks would not consider that much fun but it is plain he does people do have such different ideas of enjoyment as for norman douglas he is a perfect heathen when the last minister asked him why he never went to church he said ‘too many ugly women there parson too many ugly women i should like to go to such a man mrs dr dear and say to him solemnly ‘there is a hell  oh norman doesnt believe there is such a place said miss cornelia i hope hell find out his mistake when he comes to die there mary youve knit your three inches and you can go and play with the children for half an hour  mary needed no second bidding she flew to rainbow valley with a heart as light as her heels and in the course of conversation told faith meredith all about mrs alec davis  and mrs elliott says that shell turn all the douglases against your father and then hell have to leave the glen because his salary wont be paid concluded mary i dont know what is to be done honest to goodness if only old norman douglas would come back to church and pay it wouldnt be so bad but he wont and the douglases will leave and you all will have to go  faith carried a heavy heart to bed with her that night the thought of leaving the glen was unbearable nowhere else in the world were there such chums as the blythes her little heart had been wrung when they had left maywater she had shed many bitter tears when she parted with maywater chums and the old manse there where her mother had lived and died she could not contemplate calmly the thought of such another and harder wrench she couldnt leave glen st mary and dear rainbow valley and that delicious graveyard  its awful to be ministers family groaned faith into her pillow just as soon as you get fond of a place you are torn up by the roots ill never never never marry a minister no matter how nice he is  faith sat up in bed and looked out of the little vine hung window the night was very still the silence broken only by unas soft breathing faith felt terribly alone in the world she could see glen st mary lying under the starry blue meadows of the autumn night over the valley a light shone from the girls room at ingleside and another from walters room faith wondered if poor walter had toothache again then she sighed with a little passing sigh of envy of nan and di they had a mother and a settled home they were not at the mercy of people who got angry without any reason and called you a varmint away beyond the glen amid fields that were very quiet with sleep another light was burning faith knew it shone in the house where norman douglas lived he was reputed to sit up all hours of the night reading mary had said if he could only be induced to return to the church all would be well and why not faith looked at a big low star hanging over the tall pointed spruce at the gate of the methodist church and had an inspiration she knew what ought to be done and she faith meredith would do it she would make everything right with a sigh of satisfaction she turned from the lonely dark world and cuddled down beside una     chapter xvi tit for tat   with faith to decide was to act she lost no time in carrying out the idea as soon as she came home from school the next day she left the manse and made her way down the glen walter blythe joined her as she passed the post office  im going to mrs elliotts on an errand for mother he said where are you going faith  i am going somewhere on church business said faith loftily she did not volunteer any further information and walter felt rather snubbed they walked on in silence for a little while it was a warm windy evening with a sweet resinous air beyond the sand dunes were gray seas soft and beautiful the glen brook bore down a freight of gold and crimson leaves like fairy shallops in mr james reeses buckwheat stubble land with its beautiful tones of red and brown a crow parliament was being held whereat solemn deliberations regarding the welfare of crowland were in progress faith cruelly broke up the august assembly by climbing up on the fence and hurling a broken rail at it instantly the air was filled with flapping black wings and indignant caws  why did you do that said walter reproachfully they were having such a good time  oh i hate crows said faith airily the are so black and sly i feel sure theyre hypocrites they steal little birds eggs out of their nests you know i saw one do it on our lawn last spring walter what makes you so pale to day did you have the toothache again last night  walter shivered  yes a raging one i couldnt sleep a wink so i just paced up and down the floor and imagined i was an early christian martyr being tortured at the command of nero that helped ever so much for a while and then i got so bad i couldnt imagine anything  did you cry asked faith anxiously  no but i lay down on the floor and groaned admitted walter then the girls came in and nan put cayenne pepper in it and that made it worse di made me hold a swallow of cold water in my mouth and i couldnt stand it so they called susan susan said it served me right for sitting up in the cold garret yesterday writing poetry trash but she started up the kitchen fire and got me a hot water bottle and it stopped the toothache as soon as i felt better i told susan my poetry wasnt trash and she wasnt any judge and she said no thank goodness she was not and she did not know anything about poetry except that it was mostly a lot of lies now you know faith that isnt so that is one reason why i like writing poetry you can say so many things in it that are true in poetry but wouldnt be true in prose i told susan so but she said to stop my jawing and go to sleep before the water got cold or shed leave me to see if rhyming would cure toothache and she hoped it would be a lesson to me  why dont you go to the dentist at lowbridge and get the tooth out  walter shivered again  they want me to but i cant it would hurt so  are you afraid of a little pain asked faith contemptuously  walter flushed  it would be a big pain i hate being hurt father said he wouldnt insist on my going hed wait until id made up my own mind to go  it wouldnt hurt as long as the toothache argued faith youve had five spells of toothache if youd just go and have it out thered be no more bad nights i had a tooth out once i yelled for a moment but it was all over then only the bleeding  the bleeding is worst of all its so ugly cried walter it just made me sick when jem cut his foot last summer susan said i looked more like fainting than jem did but i couldnt bear to see jem hurt either somebody is always getting hurt faith and its awful i just cant bear to see things hurt it makes me just want to run and run and run till i cant hear or see them  theres no use making a fuss over anyone getting hurt said faith tossing her curls of course if youve hurt yourself very bad you have to yell and blood is messy and i dont like seeing other people hurt either but i dont want to run i want to go to work and help them your father has to hurt people lots of times to cure them what would they do if he ran away  i didnt say i would run i said i wanted to run thats a different thing i want to help people too but oh i wish there werent any ugly dreadful things in the world i wish everything was glad and beautiful  well dont lets think of what isnt said faith after all theres lots of fun in being alive you wouldnt have toothache if you were dead but still wouldnt you lots rather be alive than dead i would a hundred times oh heres dan reese hes been down to the harbour for fish  i hate dan reese said walter  so do i all us girls do im just going to walk past and never take the least notice of him you watch me  faith accordingly stalked past dan with her chin out and an expression of scorn that bit into his soul he turned and shouted after her  pig girl pig girl pig girl in a crescendo of insult  faith walked on seemingly oblivious but her lip trembled slightly with a sense of outrage she knew she was no match for dan reese when it came to an exchange of epithets she wished jem blythe had been with her instead of walter if dan reese had dared to call her a pig girl in jems hearing jem would have wiped up the dust with him but it never occurred to faith to expect walter to do it or blame him for not doing it walter she knew never fought other boys neither did charlie clow of the north road the strange part was that while she despised charlie for a coward it never occurred to her to disdain walter it was simply that he seemed to her an inhabitant of a world of his own where different traditions prevailed faith would as soon have expected a starry eyed young angel to pummel dirty freckled dan reese for her as walter blythe she would not have blamed the angel and she did not blame walter blythe but she wished that sturdy jem or jerry had been there and dans insult continued to rankle in her soul  walter was pale no longer he had flushed crimson and his beautiful eyes were clouded with shame and anger he knew that he ought to have avenged faith jem would have sailed right in and made dan eat his words with bitter sauce ritchie warren would have overwhelmed dan with worse names than dan had called faith but walter could not simply could not call names he knew he would get the worst of it he could never conceive or utter the vulgar ribald insults of which dan reese had unlimited command and as for the trial by fist walter couldnt fight he hated the idea it was rough and painful and worst of all it was ugly he never could understand jems exultation in an occasional conflict but he wished he could fight dan reese he was horribly ashamed because faith meredith had been insulted in his presence and he had not tried to punish her insulter he felt sure she must despise him she had not even spoken to him since dan had called her pig girl he was glad when they came to the parting of the ways  faith too was relieved though for a different reason she wanted to be alone because she suddenly felt rather nervous about her errand impulse had cooled especially since dan had bruised her self respect she must go through with it but she no longer had enthusiasm to sustain her she was going to see norman douglas and ask him to come back to church and she began to be afraid of him what had seemed so easy and simple up at the glen seemed very different down here she had heard a good deal about norman douglas and she knew that even the biggest boys in school were afraid of him suppose he called her something nasty she had heard he was given to that faith could not endure being called names they subdued her far more quickly than a physical blow but she would go on faith meredith always went on if she did not her father might have to leave the glen  at the end of the long lane faith came to the house a big old fashioned one with a row of soldierly lombardies marching past it on the back veranda norman douglas himself was sitting reading a newspaper his big dog was beside him behind in the kitchen where his housekeeper mrs wilson was getting supper there was a clatter of dishes an angry clatter for norman douglas had just had a quarrel with mrs wilson and both were in a very bad temper over it consequently when faith stepped on the veranda and norman douglas lowered his newspaper she found herself looking into the choleric eyes of an irritated man  norman douglas was rather a fine looking personage in his way he had a sweep of long red beard over his broad chest and a mane of red hair ungrizzled by the years on his massive head his high white forehead was unwrinkled and his blue eyes could flash still with all the fire of his tempestuous youth he could be very amiable when he liked and he could be very terrible poor faith so anxiously bent on retrieving the situation in regard to the church had caught him in one of his terrible moods  he did not know who she was and he gazed at her with disfavour norman douglas liked girls of spirit and flame and laughter at this moment faith was very pale she was of the type to which colour means everything lacking her crimson cheeks she seemed meek and even insignificant she looked apologetic and afraid and the bully in norman douglass heart stirred  who the dickens are you and what do you want here he demanded in his great resounding voice with a fierce scowl  for once in her life faith had nothing to say she had never supposed norman douglas was like this she was paralyzed with terror of him he saw it and it made him worse  whats the matter with you he boomed you look as if you wanted to say something and was scared to say it whats troubling you confound it speak up cant you  no faith could not speak up no words would come but her lips began to tremble  for heavens sake dont cry shouted norman i cant stand snivelling if youve anything to say say it and have done great kitty is the girl possessed of a dumb spirit dont look at me like that im human i havent got a tail who are you who are you i say  normans voice could have been heard at the harbour operations in the kitchen were suspended mrs wilson was listening open eared and eyed norman put his huge brown hands on his knees and leaned forward staring into faiths pallid shrinking face he seemed to loom over her like some evil giant out of a fairy tale she felt as if he would eat her up next thing body and bones  i am faith meredith she said in little more than a whisper  meredith hey one of the parsons youngsters hey ive heard of you ive heard of you riding on pigs and breaking the sabbath a nice lot what do you want here hey what do you want of the old pagan hey i dont ask favours of parsons and i dont give any what do you want i say  faith wished herself a thousand miles away she stammered out her thought in its naked simplicity  i came to ask you to go to church and pay to the salary  norman glared at her then he burst forth again  you impudent hussy you who put you up to it jade who put you up to it  nobody said poor faith  thats a lie dont lie to me who sent you here it wasnt your father he hasnt the smeddum of a flea but he wouldnt send you to do what he dassnt do himself i suppose it was some of them confounded old maids at the glen was it was it hey  no i i just came myself  do you take me for a fool shouted norman  no i thought you were a gentleman said faith faintly and certainly without any thought of being sarcastic  norman bounced up  mind your own business i dont want to hear another word from you if you wasnt such a kid id teach you to interfere in what doesnt concern you when i want parsons or pill dosers ill send for them till i do ill have no truck with them do you understand now get out cheese face  faith got out she stumbled blindly down the steps out of the yard gate and into the lane half way up the lane her daze of fear passed away and a reaction of tingling anger possessed her by the time she reached the end of the lane she was in such a furious temper as she had never experienced before norman douglas insults burned in her soul kindling a scorching flame go home not she she would go straight back and tell that old ogre just what she thought of him she would show him oh wouldnt she cheese face indeed  unhesitatingly she turned and walked back the veranda was deserted and the kitchen door shut faith opened the door without knocking and went in norman douglas had just sat down at the supper table but he still held his newspaper faith walked inflexibly across the room caught the paper from his hand flung it on the floor and stamped on it then she faced him with her flashing eyes and scarlet cheeks she was such a handsome young fury that norman douglas hardly recognized her  whats brought you back he growled but more in bewilderment than rage  unquailingly she glared back into the angry eyes against which so few people could hold their own  i have come back to tell you exactly what i think of you said faith in clear ringing tones i am not afraid of you you are a rude unjust tyrannical disagreeable old man susan says you are sure to go to hell and i was sorry for you but i am not now your wife never had a new hat for ten years no wonder she died i am going to make faces at you whenever i see you after this every time i am behind you you will know what is happening father has a picture of the devil in a book in his study and i mean to go home and write your name under it you are an old vampire and i hope youll have the scotch fiddle  faith did not know what a vampire meant any more than she knew what the scotch fiddle was she had heard susan use the expressions and gathered from her tone that both were dire things but norman douglas knew what the latter meant at least he had listened in absolute silence to faiths tirade when she paused for breath with a stamp of her foot he suddenly burst into loud laughter with a mighty slap of hand on knee he exclaimed  i vow youve got spunk after all i like spunk come sit down sit down  i will not faiths eyes flashed more passionately she thought she was being made fun of treated contemptuously she would have enjoyed another explosion of rage but this cut deep i will not sit down in your house i am going home but i am glad i came back here and told you exactly what my opinion of you is  so am i so am i chuckled norman i like you youre fine youre great such roses such vim did i call her cheese face why she never smelt a cheese sit down if youd looked like that at the first girl so youll write my name under the devils picture will you but hes black girl hes black and im red it wont do it wont do and you hope ill have the scotch fiddle do you lord love you girl i had it when i was a boy dont wish it on me again sit down sit in well tak a cup o kindness  no thank you said faith haughtily  oh yes you will come come now i apologize girl i apologize i made a fool of myself and im sorry man cant say fairer forget and forgive shake hands girl shake hands she wont no she wont but she must look a here girl if youll shake hands and break bread with me ill pay what i used to to the salary and ill go to church the first sunday in every month and ill make kitty alec hold her jaw im the only one in the clan can do it is it a bargain girl  it seemed a bargain faith found herself shaking hands with the ogre and then sitting at his board her temper was over faiths tempers never lasted very long but its excitement still sparkled in her eyes and crimsoned her cheeks norman douglas looked at her admiringly  go get some of your best preserves wilson he ordered and stop sulking woman stop sulking what if we did have a quarrel woman a good squall clears the air and briskens things up but no drizzling and fogging afterwards no drizzling and fogging woman i cant stand that temper in a woman but no tears for me here girl is some messed up meat and potatoes for you begin on that wilson has some fancy name for it but i call lit macanaccady anything i cant analyze in the eating line i call macanaccady and anything wet that puzzles me i call shallamagouslem wilsons tea is shallamagouslem i swear she makes it out of burdocks dont take any of the ungodly black liquid heres some milk for you what did you say your name was  faith  no name that no name that i cant stomach such a name got any other  no sir  dont like the name dont like it theres no smeddum to it besides it makes me think of my aunt jinny she called her three girls faith hope and charity faith didnt believe in anything hope was a born pessimist and charity was a miser you ought to be called red rose you look like one when youre mad ill call you red rose and youve roped me into promising to go to church but only once a month remember only once a month come now girl will you let me off i used to pay a hundred to the salary every year and go to church if i promise to pay two hundred a year will you let me off going to church come now  no no sir said faith dimpling roguishly i want you to go to church too  well a bargain is a bargain i reckon i can stand it twelve times a year what a sensation itll make the first sunday i go and old susan baker says im going to hell hey do you believe ill go there come now do you  i hope not sir stammered faith in some confusion  why do you hope not come now why do you hope not give us a reason girl give us a reason  it it must be a very uncomfortable place sir  uncomfortable all depends on your taste in comfortable girl id soon get tired of angels fancy old susan in a halo now  faith did fancy it and it tickled her so much that she had to laugh norman eyed her approvingly  see the fun of it hey oh i like you youre great about this church business now can your father preach  he is a splendid preacher said loyal faith  he is hey ill see ill watch out for flaws hed better be careful what he says before me ill catch him ill trip him up ill keep tabs on his arguments im bound to have some fun out of this church going business does he ever preach hell  no o o i dont think so  too bad i like sermons on that subject you tell him that if he wants to keep me in good humour to preach a good rip roaring sermon on hell once every six months and the more brimstone the better i like ‘em smoking and think of all the pleasure hed give the old maids too theyd all keep looking at old norman douglas and thinking ‘thats for you you old reprobate thats whats in store for you ill give an extra ten dollars every time you get your father to preach on hell heres wilson and the jam like that hey it isnt macanaccady taste  faith obediently swallowed the big spoonful norman held out to her luckily it was good  best plum jam in the world said norman filling a large saucer and plumping it down before her glad you like it ill give you a couple of jars to take home with you theres nothing mean about me never was the devil cant catch me at that corner anyhow it wasnt my fault that hester didnt have a new hat for ten years it was her own she pinched on hats to save money to give yellow fellows over in china i never gave a cent to missions in my life never will never you try to bamboozle me into that a hundred a year to the salary and church once a month but no spoiling good heathens to make poor christians why girl they wouldnt be fit for heaven or hell clean spoiled for either place clean spoiled hey wilson havent you got a smile on yet beats all how you women can sulk i never sulked in my life its just one big flash and crash with me and then pouf the squalls over and the sun is out and you could eat out of my hand  norman insisted on driving faith home after supper and he filled the buggy up with apples cabbages potatoes and pumpkins and jars of jam  theres a nice little tom pussy out in the barn ill give you that too if youd like it say the word he said  no thank you said faith decidedly i dont like cats and besides i have a rooster  listen to her you cant cuddle a rooster as you can a kitten who ever heard of petting a rooster better take little tom i want to find a good home for him  no aunt martha has a cat and he would kill a strange kitten  norman yielded the point rather reluctantly he gave faith an exciting drive home behind his wild two year old and when he had let her out at the kitchen door of the manse and dumped his cargo on the back veranda he drove away shouting  its only once a month only once a month mind  faith went up to bed feeling a little dizzy and breathless as if she had just escaped from the grasp of a genial whirlwind she was happy and thankful no fear now that they would have to leave the glen and the graveyard and rainbow valley but she fell asleep troubled by a disagreeable subconsciousness that dan reese had called her pig girl and that having stumbled on such a congenial epithet he would continue to call her so whenever opportunity offered     chapter xvii a double victory   norman douglas came to church the first sunday in november and made all the sensation he desired mr meredith shook hands with him absently on the church steps and hoped dreamily that mrs douglas was well  she wasnt very well just before i buried her ten years ago but i reckon she has better health now boomed norman to the horror and amusement of every one except mr meredith who was absorbed in wondering if he had made the last head of his sermon as clear as he might have and hadnt the least idea what norman had said to him or he to norman  norman intercepted faith at the gate  kept my word you see kept my word red rose im free now till the first sunday in december fine sermon girl fine sermon your father has more in his head than he carries on his face but he contradicted himself once tell him he contradicted himself and tell him i want that brimstone sermon in december great way to wind up the old year with a taste of hell you know and whats the matter with a nice tasty discourse on heaven for new years though it wouldnt be half as interesting as hell girl not half only id like to know what your father thinks about heaven he can think rarest thing in the world a person who can think but he did contradict himself ha ha heres a question you might ask him sometime when hes awake girl ‘can god make a stone so big he couldnt lift it himself dont forget now i want to hear his opinion on it ive stumped many a minister with that girl  faith was glad to escape him and run home dan reese standing among the crowd of boys at the gate looked at her and shaped his mouth into pig girl but dared not utter it aloud just there next day in school was a different matter at noon recess faith encountered dan in the little spruce plantation behind the school and dan shouted once more  pig girl pig girl rooster girl  walter blythe suddenly rose from a mossy cushion behind a little clump of firs where he had been reading he was very pale but his eyes blazed  you hold your tongue dan reese he said  oh hello miss walter retorted dan not at all abashed he vaulted airily to the top of the rail fence and chanted insultingly  cowardy cowardy custard stole a pot of mustard cowardy cowardy custard  you are a coincidence said walter scornfully turning still whiter he had only a very hazy idea what a coincidence was but dan had none at all and thought it must be something peculiarly opprobrious  yah cowardy he yelled gain your mother writes lies lies lies and faith meredith is a pig girl a pig girl a pig girl and shes a rooster girl a rooster girl a rooster girl yah cowardy cowardy cust   dan got no further walter had hurled himself across the intervening space and knocked dan off the fence backward with one well directed blow dans sudden inglorious sprawl was greeted with a burst of laughter and a clapping of hands from faith dan sprang up purple with rage and began to climb the fence but just then the school bell rang and dan knew what happened to boys who were late during mr hazards regime  well fight this out he howled cowardy  any time you like said walter  oh no no walter protested faith dont fight him i dont mind what he says i wouldnt condescend to mind the like of him  he insulted you and he insulted my mother said walter with the same deadly calm tonight after school dan  ive got to go right home from school to pick taters after the harrows dad says answered dan sulkily but to morrow nightll do  all right here to morrow night agreed walter  and ill smash your sissy face for you promised dan  walter shuddered not so much from fear of the threat as from repulsion over the ugliness and vulgarity of it but he held his head high and marched into school faith followed in a conflict of emotions she hated to think of walter fighting that little sneak but oh he had been splendid and he was going to fight for her faith meredith to punish her insulter of course he would win such eyes spelled victory  faiths confidence in her champion had dimmed a little by evening however walter had seemed so very quiet and dull the rest of the day in school  if it were only jem she sighed to una as they sat on hezekiah pollocks tombstone in the graveyard he is such a fighter he could finish dan off in no time but walter doesnt know much about fighting  im so afraid hell be hurt sighed una who hated fighting and couldnt understand the subtle secret exultation she divined in faith  he oughtnt to be said faith uncomfortably hes every bit as big as dan  but dans so much older said una why hes nearly a year older  dan hasnt done much fighting when you come to count up said faith i believe hes really a coward he didnt think walter would fight or he wouldnt have called names before him oh if you could just have seen walters face when he looked at him una it made me shiver with a nice shiver he looked just like sir galahad in that poem father read us on saturday  i hate the thought of them fighting and i wish it could be stopped said una  oh its got to go on now cried faith its a matter of honour dont you dare tell anyone una if you do ill never tell you secrets again  i wont tell agreed una but i wont stay to morrow to watch the fight im coming right home  oh all right i have to be there it would be mean not to when walter is fighting for me im going to tie my colours on his arm thats the thing to do when hes my knight how lucky mrs blythe gave me that pretty blue hair ribbon for my birthday ive only worn it twice so it will be almost new but i wish i was sure walter would win it will be so so humiliating if he doesnt  faith would have been yet more dubious if she could have seen her champion just then walter had gone home from school with all his righteous anger at a low ebb and a very nasty feeling in its place he had to fight dan reese the next night and he didnt want to he hated the thought of it and he kept thinking of it all the time not for a minute could he get away from the thought would it hurt much he was terribly afraid that it would hurt and would he be defeated and shamed  he could not eat any supper worth speaking of susan had made a big batch of his favourite monkey faces but he could choke only one down jem ate four walter wondered how he could how could anybody eat and how could they all talk gaily as they were doing there was mother with her shining eyes and pink cheeks she didnt know her son had to fight next day would she be so gay if she knew walter wondered darkly jem had taken susans picture with his new camera and the result was passed around the table and susan was terribly indignant over it  i am no beauty mrs dr dear and well i know it and have always known it she said in an aggrieved tone but that i am as ugly as that picture makes me out i will never no never believe  jem laughed over this and anne laughed again with him walter couldnt endure it he got up and fled to his room  that child has got something on his mind mrs dr dear said susan he has et next to nothing do you suppose he is plotting another poem  poor walter was very far removed in spirit from the starry realms of poesy just then he propped his elbow on his open window sill and leaned his head drearily on his hands  come on down to the shore walter cried jem busting in the boys are going to burn the sand hill grass to night father says we can go come on  at any other time walter would have been delighted he gloried in the burning of the sand hill grass but now he flatly refused to go and no arguments or entreaties could move him disappointed jem who did not care for the long dark walk to four winds point alone retreated to his museum in the garret and buried himself in a book he soon forgot his disappointment revelling with the heroes of old romance and pausing occasionally to picture himself a famous general leading his troops to victory on some great battlefield  walter sat at his window until bedtime di crept in hoping to be told what was wrong but walter could not talk of it even to di talking of it seemed to give it a reality from which he shrank it was torture enough to think of it the crisp withered leaves rustled on the maple trees outside his window the glow of rose and flame had died out of the hollow silvery sky and the full moon was rising gloriously over rainbow valley afar off a ruddy woodfire was painting a page of glory on the horizon beyond the hills it was a sharp clear evening when far away sounds were heard distinctly a fox was barking across the pond an engine was puffing down at the glen station a blue jay was screaming madly in the maple grove there was laughter over on the manse lawn how could people laugh how could foxes and blue jays and engines behave as if nothing were going to happen on the morrow  oh i wish it was over groaned walter  he slept very little that night and had hard work choking down his porridge in the morning susan was rather lavish in her platefuls mr hazard found him an unsatisfactory pupil that day faith merediths wits seemed to be wool gathering too dan reese kept drawing surreptitious pictures of girls with pig or rooster heads on his slate and holding them up for all to see the news of the coming battle had leaked out and most of the boys and many of the girls were in the spruce plantation when dan and walter sought it after school una had gone home but faith was there having tied her blue ribbon around walters arm walter was thankful that neither jem nor di nor nan were among the crowd of spectators somehow they had not heard of what was in the wind and had gone home too walter faced dan quite undauntedly now at the last moment all his fear had vanished but he still felt disgust at the idea of fighting dan it was noted was really paler under his freckles than walter was one of the older boys gave the word and dan struck walter in the face  walter reeled a little the pain of the blow tingled through all his sensitive frame for a moment then he felt pain no longer something such as he had never experienced before seemed to roll over him like a flood his face flushed crimson his eyes burned like flame the scholars of glen st mary school had never dreamed that miss walter could look like that he hurled himself forward and closed with dan like a young wildcat  there were no particular rules in the fights of the glen school boys it was catch as catch can and get your blows in anyhow walter fought with a savage fury and a joy in the struggle against which dan could not hold his ground it was all over very speedily walter had no clear consciousness of what he was doing until suddenly the red mist cleared from his sight and he found himself kneeling on the body of the prostrate dan whose nose oh horror was spouting blood  have you had enough demanded walter through his clenched teeth  dan sulkily admitted that he had  my mother doesnt write lies  no  faith meredith isnt a pig girl  no  nor a rooster girl  no  and im not a coward  no  walter had intended to ask and you are a liar but pity intervened and he did not humiliate dan further besides that blood was so horrible  you can go then he said contemptuously  there was a loud clapping from the boys who were perched on the rail fence but some of the girls were crying they were frightened they had seen schoolboy fights before but nothing like walter as he had grappled with dan there had been something terrifying about him they thought he would kill dan now that all was over they sobbed hysterically except faith who still stood tense and crimson cheeked  walter did not stay for any conquerors meed he sprang over the fence and rushed down the spruce hill to rainbow valley he felt none of the victors joy but he felt a certain calm satisfaction in duty done and honour avenged mingled with a sickish qualm when he thought of dans gory nose it had been so ugly and walter hated ugliness  also he began to realize that he himself was somewhat sore and battered up his lip was cut and swollen and one eye felt very strange in rainbow valley he encountered mr meredith who was coming home from an afternoon call on the miss wests that reverend gentleman looked gravely at him  it seems to me that you have been fighting walter  yes sir said walter expecting a scolding  what was it about  dan reese said my mother wrote lies and that that faith was a pig girl answered walter bluntly  oh h then you were certainly justified walter  do you think its right to fight sir asked walter curiously  not always and not often but sometimes yes sometimes said john meredith when womenkind are insulted for instance as in your case my motto walter is dont fight till youre sure you ought to and then put every ounce of you into it in spite of sundry discolorations i infer that you came off best  yes i made him take it all back  very good very good indeed i didnt think you were such a fighter walter  i never fought before and i didnt want to right up to the last and then said walter determined to make a clean breast of it i liked it while i was at it  the rev johns eyes twinkled  you were a little frightened at first  i was a whole lot frightened said honest walter but im not going to be frightened any more sir being frightened of things is worse than the things themselves im going to ask father to take me over to lowbridge to morrow to get my tooth out  right again ‘fear is more pain than is the pain it fears do you know who wrote that walter it was shakespeare was there any feeling or emotion or experience of the human heart that that wonderful man did not know when you go home tell your mother i am proud of you  walter did not tell her that however but he told her all the rest and she sympathized with him and told him she was glad he had stood up for her and faith and she anointed his sore spots and rubbed cologne on his aching head  are all mothers as nice as you asked walter hugging her youre worth standing up for  miss cornelia and susan were in the living room when anne came downstairs and listened to the story with much enjoyment susan in particular was highly gratified  i am real glad to hear he has had a good fight mrs dr dear perhaps it may knock that poetry nonsense out of him and i never no never could bear that little viper of a dan reese will you not sit nearer to the fire mrs marshall elliott these november evenings are very chilly  thank you susan im not cold i called at the manse before i came here and got quite warm though i had to go to the kitchen to do it for there was no fire anywhere else the kitchen looked as if it had been stirred up with a stick believe me mr meredith wasnt home i couldnt find out where he was but i have an idea that he was up at the wests do you know anne dearie they say he has been going there frequently all the fall and people are beginning to think he is going to see rosemary  he would get a very charming wife if he married rosemary said anne piling driftwood on the fire she is one of the most delightful girls ive ever known truly one of the race of joseph  ye s only she is an episcopalian said miss cornelia doubtfully of course that is better than if she was a methodist but i do think mr meredith could find a good enough wife in his own denomination however very likely there is nothing in it its only a month ago that i said to him ‘you ought to marry again mr meredith he looked as shocked as if i had suggested something improper ‘my wife is in her grave mrs elliott he said in that gentle saintly way of his ‘i suppose so i said ‘or i wouldnt be advising you to marry again then he looked more shocked than ever so i doubt if there is much in this rosemary story if a single minister calls twice at a house where there is a single woman all the gossips have it he is courting her  it seems to me if i may presume to say so that mr meredith is too shy to go courting a second wife said susan solemnly  he isnt shy believe me retorted miss cornelia absent minded yes but shy no and for all he is so abstracted and dreamy he has a very good opinion of himself man like and when he is really awake he wouldnt think it much of a chore to ask any woman to have him no the trouble is hes deluding himself into believing that his heart is buried while all the time its beating away inside of him just like anybody elses he may have a notion of rosemary west and he may not if he has we must make the best of it she is a sweet girl and a fine housekeeper and would make a good mother for those poor neglected children and concluded miss cornelia resignedly my own grandmother was an episcopalian     chapter xviii mary brings evil tidings   mary vance whom mrs elliott had sent up to the manse on an errand came tripping down rainbow valley on her way to ingleside where she was to spend the afternoon with nan and di as a saturday treat nan and di had been picking spruce gum with faith and una in the manse woods and the four of them were now sitting on a fallen pine by the brook all it must be admitted chewing rather vigorously the ingleside twins were not allowed to chew spruce gum anywhere but in the seclusion of rainbow valley but faith and una were unrestricted by such rules of etiquette and cheerfully chewed it everywhere at home and abroad to the very proper horror of the glen faith had been chewing it in church one day but jerry had realized the enormity of that and had given her such an older brotherly scolding that she never did it again  i was so hungry i just felt as if i had to chew something she protested you know well enough what breakfast was like jerry meredith i couldnt eat scorched porridge and my stomach just felt so queer and empty the gum helped a lot and i didnt chew very hard i didnt make any noise and i never cracked the gum once  you mustnt chew gum in church anyhow insisted jerry dont let me catch you at it again  you chewed yourself in prayer meeting last week cried faith  thats different said jerry loftily prayer meeting isnt on sunday besides i sat away at the back in a dark seat and nobody saw me you were sitting right up front where every one saw you and i took the gum out of my mouth for the last hymn and stuck it on the back of the pew right up in front where every one saw you then i came away and forgot it i went back to get it next morning but it was gone i suppose rod warren swiped it and it was a dandy chew  mary vance walked down the valley with her head held high she had on a new blue velvet cap with a scarlet rosette in it a coat of navy blue cloth and a little squirrel fur muff she was very conscious of her new clothes and very well pleased with herself her hair was elaborately crimped her face was quite plump her cheeks rosy her white eyes shining she did not look much like the forlorn and ragged waif the merediths had found in the old taylor barn una tried not to feel envious here was mary with a new velvet cap but she and faith had to wear their shabby old gray tams again this winter nobody ever thought of getting them new ones and they were afraid to ask their father for them for fear that he might be short of money and then he would feel badly mary had told them once that ministers were always short of money and found it awful hard to make ends meet since then faith and una would have gone in rags rather than ask their father for anything if they could help it they did not worry a great deal over their shabbiness but it was rather trying to see mary vance coming out in such style and putting on such airs about it too the new squirrel muff was really the last straw neither faith nor una had ever had a muff counting themselves lucky if they could compass mittens without holes in them aunt martha could not see to darn holes and though una tried to she made sad cobbling somehow they could not make their greeting of mary very cordial but mary did not mind or notice that she was not overly sensitive she vaulted lightly to a seat on the pine tree and laid the offending muff on a bough una saw that it was lined with shirred red satin and had red tassels she looked down at her own rather purple chapped little hands and wondered if she would ever ever be able to put them into a muff like that  give us a chew said mary companionably nan di and faith all produced an amber hued knot or two from their pockets and passed them to mary una sat very still she had four lovely big knots in the pocket of her tight thread bare little jacket but she wasnt going to give one of them to mary vance not one let mary pick her own gum people with squirrel muffs neednt expect to get everything in the world  great day isnt it said mary swinging her legs the better perhaps to display new boots with very smart cloth tops una tucked her feet under her there was a hole in the toe of one of her boots and both laces were much knotted but they were the best she had oh this mary vance why hadnt they left her in the old barn  una never felt badly because the ingleside twins were better dressed than she and faith were they wore their pretty clothes with careless grace and never seemed to think about them at all somehow they did not make other people feel shabby but when mary vance was dressed up she seemed fairly to exude clothes to walk in an atmosphere of clothes to make everybody else feel and think clothes una as she sat there in the honey tinted sunshine of the gracious december afternoon was acutely and miserably conscious of everything she had on the faded tam which was yet her best the skimpy jacket she had worn for three winters the holes in her skirt and her boots the shivering insufficiency of her poor little undergarments of course mary was going out for a visit and she was not but even if she had been she had nothing better to put on and in this lay the sting  say this is great gum listen to me cracking it there aint any gum spruces down at four winds said mary sometimes i just hanker after a chew mrs elliott wont let me chew gum if she sees me she says it aint lady like this lady business puzzles me i cant get on to all its kinks say una whats the matter with you cat got your tongue  no said una who could not drag her fascinated eyes from that squirrel muff mary leaned past her picked it up and thrust it into unas hands  stick your paws in that for a while she ordered they look sorter pinched aint that a dandy muff mrs elliott give it to me last week for a birthday present im to get the collar at christmas i heard her telling mr elliott that  mrs elliott is very good to you said faith  you bet she is and im good to her too retorted mary i work like a nigger to make it easy for her and have everything just as she likes it we was made for each other ‘tisnt every one could get along with her as well as i do shes pizen neat but so am i and so we agree fine  i told you she would never whip you  so you did shes never tried to lay a finger on me and i aint never told a lie to her not one trues you live she combs me down with her tongue sometimes though but that just slips off me like water off a ducks back say una why didnt you hang on to the muff  una had put it back on the bough  my hands arent cold thank you she said stiffly  well if youre satisfied i am say old kitty alec has come back to church as meek as moses and nobody knows why but everybody is saying it was faith brought norman douglas out his housekeeper says you went there and gave him an awful tongue lashing did you  i went and asked him to come to church said faith uncomfortably  fancy your spunk said mary admiringly i wouldnt have dared do that and im not so slow mrs wilson says the two of you jawed something scandalous but you come off best and then he just turned round and like to eat you up say is your father going to preach here to morrow  no hes going to exchange with mr perry from charlottetown father went to town this morning and mr perry is coming out to night  i thought there was something in the wind though old martha wouldnt give me any satisfaction but i felt sure she wouldnt have been killing that rooster for nothing  what rooster what do you mean cried faith turning pale  i dont know what rooster i didnt see it when she took the butter mrs elliott sent up she said shed been out to the barn killing a rooster for dinner tomorrow  faith sprang down from the pine  its adam we have no other rooster she has killed adam  now dont fly off the handle martha said the butcher at the glen had no meat this week and she had to have something and the hens were all laying and too poor  if she has killed adam  faith began to run up the hill  mary shrugged her shoulders  shell go crazy now she was so fond of that adam he ought to have been in the pot long ago hell be as tough as sole leather but i wouldnt like to be in marthas shoes faiths just white with rage una youd better go after her and try to peacify her  mary had gone a few steps with the blythe girls when una suddenly turned and ran after her  heres some gum for you mary she said with a little repentant catch in her voice thrusting all her four knots into marys hands and im glad you have such a pretty muff  why thanks said mary rather taken by surprise to the blythe girls after una had gone she said aint she a queer little mite but ive always said she had a good heart     chapter xix poor adam   when una got home faith was lying face downwards on her bed utterly refusing to be comforted aunt martha had killed adam he was reposing on a platter in the pantry that very minute trussed and dressed encircled by his liver and heart and gizzard aunt martha heeded faiths passion of grief and anger not a whit  we had to have something for the strange ministers dinner she said youre too big a girl to make such a fuss over an old rooster you knew hed have to be killed sometime  ill tell father when he comes home what youve done sobbed faith  dont you go bothering your poor father he has troubles enough and im housekeeper here  adam was mine mrs johnson gave him to me you had no business to touch him stormed faith  dont you get sassy now the roosters killed and theres an end of it i aint going to set no strange minister down to a dinner of cold biled mutton i was brought up to know better than that if i have come down in the world  faith would not go down to supper that night and she would not go to church the next morning but at dinner time she went to the table her eyes swollen with crying her face sullen  the rev james perry was a sleek rubicund man with a bristling white moustache bushy white eyebrows and a shining bald head he was certainly not handsome and he was a very tiresome pompous sort of person but if he had looked like the archangel michael and talked with the tongues of men and angels faith would still have utterly detested him he carved adam up dexterously showing off his plump white hands and very handsome diamond ring also he made jovial remarks all through the performance jerry and carl giggled and even una smiled wanly because she thought politeness demanded it but faith only scowled darkly the rev james thought her manners shockingly bad once when he was delivering himself of an unctuous remark to jerry faith broke in rudely with a flat contradiction the rev james drew his bushy eyebrows together at her  little girls should not interrupt he said and they should not contradict people who know far more than they do  this put faith in a worse temper than ever to be called little girl as if she were no bigger than chubby rilla blythe over at ingleside it was insufferable and how that abominable mr perry did eat he even picked poor adams bones neither faith nor una would touch a mouthful and looked upon the boys as little better than cannibals faith felt that if that awful repast did not soon come to an end she would wind it up by throwing something at mr perrys gleaming head fortunately mr perry found aunt marthas leathery apple pie too much even for his powers of mastication and the meal came to an end after a long grace in which mr perry offered up devout thanks for the food which a kind and beneficent providence had provided for sustenance and temperate pleasure  god hadnt a single thing to do with providing adam for you muttered faith rebelliously under her breath  the boys gladly made their escape to outdoors una went to help aunt martha with the dishes though that rather grumpy old dame never welcomed her timid assistance and faith betook herself to the study where a cheerful wood fire was burning in the grate she thought she would thereby escape from the hated mr perry who had announced his intention of taking a nap in his room during the afternoon but scarcely had faith settled herself in a corner with a book when he walked in and standing before the fire proceeded to survey the disorderly study with an air of disapproval  you fathers books seem to be in somewhat deplorable confusion my little girl he said severely  faith darkled in her corner and said not a word she would not talk to this this creature  you should try to put them in order mr perry went on playing with his handsome watch chain and smiling patronizingly on faith you are quite old enough to attend to such duties my little daughter at home is only ten and she is already an excellent little housekeeper and the greatest help and comfort to her mother she is a very sweet child i wish you had the privilege of her acquaintance she could help you in many ways of course you have not had the inestimable privilege of a good mothers care and training a sad lack a very sad lack i have spoken more than once to your father in this connection and pointed out his duty to him faithfully but so far with no effect i trust he may awaken to a realization of his responsibility before it is too late in the meantime it is your duty and privilege to endeavour to take your sainted mothers place you might exercise a great influence over your brothers and your little sister you might be a true mother to them i fear that you do not think of these things as you should my dear child allow me to open your eyes in regard to them  mr perrys oily complacent voice trickled on he was in his element nothing suited him better than to lay down the law patronize and exhort he had no idea of stopping and he did not stop he stood before the fire his feet planted firmly on the rug and poured out a flood of pompous platitudes faith heard not a word she was really not listening to him at all but she was watching his long black coat tails with impish delight growing in her brown eyes mr perry was standing very near the fire his coat tails began to scorch his coat tails began to smoke he still prosed on wrapped up in his own eloquence the coat tails smoked worse a tiny spark flew up from the burning wood and alighted in the middle of one it clung and caught and spread into a smouldering flame faith could restrain herself no longer and broke into a stifled giggle  mr perry stopped short angered over this impertinence suddenly he became conscious that a reek of burning cloth filled the room he whirled round and saw nothing then he clapped his hands to his coat tails and brought them around in front of him there was already quite a hole in one of them and this was his new suit faith shook with helpless laughter over his pose and expression  did you see my coat tails burning he demanded angrily  yes sir said faith demurely  why didnt you tell me he demanded glaring at her  you said it wasnt good manners to interrupt sir said faith more demurely still  if if i was your father i would give you a spanking that you would remember all your life miss said a very angry reverend gentleman as he stalked out of the study the coat of mr merediths second best suit would not fit mr perry so he had to go to the evening service with his singed coat tail but he did not walk up the aisle with his usual consciousness of the honour he was conferring on the building he never would agree to an exchange of pulpits with mr meredith again and he was barely civil to the latter when they met for a few minutes at the station the next morning but faith felt a certain gloomy satisfaction adam was partially avenged     chapter xx faith makes a friend   next day in school was a hard one for faith mary vance had told the tale of adam and all the scholars except the blythes thought it quite a joke the girls told faith between giggles that it was too bad and the boys wrote sardonic notes of condolence to her poor faith went home from school feeling her very soul raw and smarting within her  im going over to ingleside to have a talk with mrs blythe she sobbed she wont laugh at me as everybody else does ive just got to talk to somebody who understands how bad i feel  she ran down through rainbow valley enchantment had been at work the night before a light snow had fallen and the powdered firs were dreaming of a spring to come and a joy to be the long hill beyond was richly purple with leafless beeches the rosy light of sunset lay over the world like a pink kiss of all the airy fairy places full of weird elfin grace rainbow valley that winter evening was the most beautiful but all its dreamlike loveliness was lost on poor sore hearted little faith  by the brook she came suddenly upon rosemary west who was sitting on the old pine tree she was on her way home from ingleside where she had been giving the girls their music lesson she had been lingering in rainbow valley quite a little time looking across its white beauty and roaming some by ways of dream judging from the expression of her face her thoughts were pleasant ones perhaps the faint occasional tinkle from the bells on the tree lovers brought the little lurking smile to her lips or perhaps it was occasioned by the consciousness that john meredith seldom failed to spend monday evening in the gray house on the white wind swept hill  into rosemarys dreams burst faith meredith full of rebellious bitterness faith stopped abruptly when she saw miss west she did not know her very well just well enough to speak to when they met and she did not want to see any one just then except mrs blythe she knew her eyes and nose were red and swollen and she hated to have a stranger know she had been crying  good evening miss west she said uncomfortably  what is the matter faith asked rosemary gently  nothing said faith rather shortly  oh rosemary smiled you mean nothing that you can tell to outsiders dont you  faith looked at miss west with sudden interest here was a person who understood things and how pretty she was how golden her hair was under her plumy hat how pink her cheeks were over her velvet coat how blue and companionable her eyes were faith felt that miss west could be a lovely friend if only she were a friend instead of a stranger  i im going up to tell mrs blythe said faith she always understands she never laughs at us i always talk things over with her it helps  dear girlie im sorry to have to tell you that mrs blythe isnt home said miss west sympathetically she went to avonlea to day and isnt coming back till the last of the week  faiths lip quivered  then i might as well go home again she said miserably  i suppose so unless you think you could bring yourself to talk it over with me instead said miss rosemary gently it is such a help to talk things over i know i dont suppose i can be as good at understanding as mrs blythe but i promise you that i wont laugh  you wouldnt laugh outside hesitated faith but you might inside  no i wouldnt laugh inside either why should i something has hurt you it never amuses me to see anybody hurt no matter what hurts them if you feel that youd like to tell me what has hurt you ill be glad to listen but if you think youd rather not thats all right too dear  faith took another long earnest look into miss wests eyes they were very serious there was no laughter in them not even far far back with a little sigh she sat down on the old pine beside her new friend and told her all about adam and his cruel fate  rosemary did not laugh or feel like laughing she understood and sympathized really she was almost as good as mrs blythe yes quite as good  mr perry is a minister but he should have been a butcher said faith bitterly he is so fond of carving things up he enjoyed cutting poor adam to pieces he just sliced into him as if he were any common rooster  between you and me faith i dont like mr perry very well myself said rosemary laughing a little but at mr perry not at adam as faith clearly understood i never did like him i went to school with him he was a glen boy you know and he was a most detestable little prig even then oh how we girls used to hate holding his fat clammy hands in the ring around games but we must remember dear that he didnt know that adam had been a pet of yours he thought he was just a common rooster we must be just even when we are terribly hurt  i suppose so admitted faith but why does everybody seem to think it funny that i should have loved adam so much miss west if it had been a horrid old cat nobody would have thought it queer when lottie warrens kitten had its legs cut off by the binder everybody was sorry for her she cried two days in school and nobody laughed at her not even dan reese and all her chums went to the kittens funeral and helped her bury it only they couldnt bury its poor little paws with it because they couldnt find them it was a horrid thing to have happen of course but i dont think it was as dreadful as seeing your pet eaten up yet everybody laughs at me  i think it is because the name ‘rooster seems rather a funny one said rosemary gravely there is something in it that is comical now ‘chicken is different it doesnt sound so funny to talk of loving a chicken  adam was the dearest little chicken miss west he was just a little golden ball he would run up to me and peck out of my hand and he was handsome when he grew up too white as snow with such a beautiful curving white tail though mary vance said it was too short he knew his name and always came when i called him he was a very intelligent rooster and aunt martha had no right to kill him he was mine it wasnt fair was it miss west  no it wasnt said rosemary decidedly not a bit fair i remember i had a pet hen when i was a little girl she was such a pretty little thing all golden brown and speckly i loved her as much as i ever loved any pet she was never killed she died of old age mother wouldnt have her killed because she was my pet  if my mother had been living she wouldnt have let adam be killed said faith for that matter father wouldnt have either if hed been home and known of it im sure he wouldnt miss west  im sure too said rosemary there was a little added flush on her face she looked rather conscious but faith noticed nothing  was it very wicked of me not to tell mr perry his coat tails were scorching she asked anxiously  oh terribly wicked answered rosemary with dancing eyes but i would have been just as naughty faith i wouldnt have told him they were scorching and i dont believe i would ever have been a bit sorry for my wickedness either  una thought i should have told him because he was a minister  dearest if a minister doesnt behave as a gentleman we are not bound to respect his coat tails i know i would just have loved to see jimmy perrys coat tails burning up it must have been fun  both laughed but faith ended with a bitter little sigh  well anyway adam is dead and i am never going to love anything again  dont say that dear we miss so much out of life if we dont love the more we love the richer life is even if it is only some little furry or feathery pet would you like a canary faith a little golden bit of a canary if you would ill give you one we have two up home  oh i would like that cried faith i love birds only would aunt marthas cat eat it its so tragic to have your pets eaten i dont think i could endure it a second time  if you hang the cage far enough from the wall i dont think the cat could harm it ill tell you just how to take care of it and ill bring it to ingleside for you the next time i come down  to herself rosemary was thinking  it will give every gossip in the glen something to talk of but i will not care i want to comfort this poor little heart  faith was comforted sympathy and understanding were very sweet she and miss rosemary sat on the old pine until the twilight crept softly down over the white valley and the evening star shone over the gray maple grove faith told rosemary all her small history and hopes her likes and dislikes the ins and outs of life at the manse the ups and downs of school society finally they parted firm friends  mr meredith was as usual lost in dreams when supper began that evening but presently a name pierced his abstraction and brought him back to reality faith was telling una of her meeting with rosemary  she is just lovely i think said faith just as nice as mrs blythe but different i felt as if i wanted to hug her she did hug me such a nice velvety hug and she called me ‘dearest it thriled me i could tell her anything  so you liked miss west faith mr meredith asked with a rather odd intonation  i love her cried faith  ah said mr meredith ah     chapter xxi the impossible word   john meredith walked meditatively through the clear crispness of a winter night in rainbow valley the hills beyond glistened with the chill splendid lustre of moonlight on snow every little fir tree in the long valley sang its own wild song to the harp of wind and frost his children and the blythe lads and lasses were coasting down the eastern slope and whizzing over the glassy pond they were having a glorious time and their gay voices and gayer laughter echoed up and down the valley dying away in elfin cadences among the trees on the right the lights of ingleside gleamed through the maple grove with the genial lure and invitation which seems always to glow in the beacons of a home where we know there is love and good cheer and a welcome for all kin whether of flesh or spirit mr meredith liked very well on occasion to spend an evening arguing with the doctor by the drift wood fire where the famous china dogs of ingleside kept ceaseless watch and ward as became deities of the hearth but to night he did not look that way far on the western hill gleamed a paler but more alluring star mr meredith was on his way to see rosemary west and he meant to tell her something which had been slowly blossoming in his heart since their first meeting and had sprung into full flower on the evening when faith had so warmly voiced her admiration for rosemary  he had come to realize that he had learned to care for rosemary not as he had cared for cecilia of course that was entirely different that love of romance and dream and glamour could never he thought return but rosemary was beautiful and sweet and dear very dear she was the best of companions he was happier in her company than he had ever expected to be again she would be an ideal mistress for his home a good mother to his children  during the years of his widowhood mr meredith had received innumerable hints from brother members of presbytery and from many parishioners who could not be suspected of any ulterior motive as well as from some who could that he ought to marry again  but these hints never made any impression on him it was commonly thought he was never aware of them but he was quite acutely aware of them and in his own occasional visitations of common sense he knew that the common sensible thing for him to do was to marry but common sense was not the strong point of john meredith and to choose out deliberately and cold bloodedly some suitable woman as one might choose a housekeeper or a business partner was something he was quite incapable of doing how he hated that word suitable it reminded him so strongly of james perry a suit able woman of suit able age that unctuous brother of the cloth had said in his far from subtle hint for the moment john meredith had had a perfectly unbelievable desire to rush madly away and propose marriage to the youngest most unsuitable woman it was possible to discover  mrs marshall elliott was his good friend and he liked her but when she had bluntly told him he should marry again he felt as if she had torn away the veil that hung before some sacred shrine of his innermost life and he had been more or less afraid of her ever since he knew there were women in his congregation of suitable age who would marry him quite readily that fact had seeped through all his abstraction very early in his ministry in glen st mary they were good substantial uninteresting women one or two fairly comely the others not exactly so and john meredith would as soon have thought of marrying any one of them as of hanging himself he had some ideals to which no seeming necessity could make him false he could ask no woman to fill cecilias place in his home unless he could offer her at least some of the affection and homage he had given to his girlish bride and where in his limited feminine acquaintance was such a woman to be found  rosemary west had come into his life on that autumn evening bringing with her an atmosphere in which his spirit recognized native air across the gulf of strangerhood they clasped hands of friendship he knew her better in that ten minutes by the hidden spring than he knew emmeline drew or elizabeth kirk or amy annetta douglas in a year or could know them in a century he had fled to her for comfort when mrs alec davis had outraged his mind and soul and had found it since then he had gone often to the house on the hill slipping through the shadowy paths of night in rainbow valley so astutely that glen gossip could never be absolutely certain that he did go to see rosemary west once or twice he had been caught in the west living room by other visitors that was all the ladies aid had to go by but when elizabeth kirk heard it she put away a secret hope she had allowed herself to cherish without a change of expression on her kind plain face and emmeline drew resolved that the next time she saw a certain old bachelor of lowbridge she would not snub him as she had done at a previous meeting of course if rosemary west was out to catch the minister she would catch him she looked younger than she was and men thought her pretty besides the west girls had money  it is to be hoped that he wont be so absent minded as to propose to ellen by mistake was the only malicious thing she allowed herself to say to a sympathetic sister drew emmeline bore no further grudge towards rosemary when all was said and done an unencumbered bachelor was far better than a widower with four children it had been only the glamour of the manse that had temporarily blinded emmelines eyes to the better part  a sled with three shrieking occupants sped past mr meredith to the pond faiths long curls streamed in the wind and her laughter rang above that of the others john meredith looked after them kindly and longingly he was glad that his children had such chums as the blythes glad that they had so wise and gay and tender a friend as mrs blythe but they needed something more and that something would be supplied when he brought rosemary west as a bride to the old manse there was in her a quality essentially maternal  it was saturday night and he did not often go calling on saturday night which was supposed to be dedicated to a thoughtful revision of sundays sermon but he had chosen this night because he had learned that ellen west was going to be away and rosemary would be alone often as he had spent pleasant evenings in the house on the hill he had never since that first meeting at the spring seen rosemary alone ellen had always been there  he did not precisely object to ellen being there he liked ellen west very much and they were the best of friends ellen had an almost masculine understanding and a sense of humour which his own shy hidden appreciation of fun found very agreeable he liked her interest in politics and world events there was no man in the glen not even excepting dr blythe who had a better grasp of such things  i think it is just as well to be interested in things as long as you live she had said if youre not it doesnt seem to me that theres much difference between the quick and the dead  he liked her pleasant deep rumbly voice he liked the hearty laugh with which she always ended up some jolly and well told story she never gave him digs about his children as other glen women did she never bored him with local gossip she had no malice and no pettiness she was always splendidly sincere mr meredith who had picked up miss cornelias way of classifying people considered that ellen belonged to the race of joseph altogether an admirable woman for a sister in law nevertheless a man did not want even the most admirable of women around when he was proposing to another woman and ellen was always around she did not insist on talking to mr meredith herself all the time she let rosemary have a fair share of him many evenings indeed ellen effaced herself almost totally sitting back in the corner with st george in her lap and letting mr meredith and rosemary talk and sing and read books together sometimes they quite forgot her presence but if their conversation or choice of duets ever betrayed the least tendency to what ellen considered philandering ellen promptly nipped that tendency in the bud and blotted rosemary out for the rest of the evening but not even the grimmest of amiable dragons can altogether prevent a certain subtle language of eye and smile and eloquent silence and so the ministers courtship progressed after a fashion  but if it was ever to reach a climax that climax must come when ellen was away and ellen was so seldom away especially in winter she found her own fireside the pleasantest place in the world she vowed gadding had no attraction for her she was fond of company but she wanted it at home mr meredith had almost been driven to the conclusion that he must write to rosemary what he wanted to say when ellen casually announced one evening that she was going to a silver wedding next saturday night she had been bridesmaid when the principals were married only old guests were invited so rosemary was not included mr meredith pricked up his ears a trifle and a gleam flashed into his dreamy dark eyes both ellen and rosemary saw it and both ellen and rosemary felt with a tingling shock that mr meredith would certainly come up the hill next saturday night  might as well have it over with st george ellen sternly told the black cat after mr meredith had gone home and rosemary had silently gone upstairs he means to ask her st george im perfectly sure of that so he might as well have his chance to do it and find out he cant get her george shed rather like to take him saint i know that but she promised and shes got to keep her promise im rather sorry in some ways st george i dont know of a man id sooner have for a brother in law if a brother in law was convenient i havent a thing against him saint not a thing except that he wont see and cant be made to see that the kaiser is a menace to the peace of europe thats his blind spot but hes good company and i like him a woman can say anything she likes to a man with a mouth like john merediths and be sure of not being misunderstood such a man is more precious than rubies saint and much rarer george but he cant have rosemary and i suppose when he finds out he cant have her hell drop us both and well miss him saint well miss him something scandalous george but she promised and ill see that she keeps her promise  ellens face looked almost ugly in its lowering resolution upstairs rosemary was crying into her pillow  so mr meredith found his lady alone and looking very beautiful rosemary had not made any special toilet for the occasion she wanted to but she thought it would be absurd to dress up for a man you meant to refuse so she wore her plain dark afternoon dress and looked like a queen in it her suppressed excitement coloured her face to brilliancy her great blue eyes were pools of light less placid than usual  she wished the interview were over she had looked forward to it all day with dread she felt quite sure that john meredith cared a great deal for her after a fashion and she felt just as sure that he did not care for her as he had cared for his first love she felt that her refusal would disappoint him considerably but she did not think it would altogether overwhelm him yet she hated to make it hated for his sake and rosemary was quite honest with herself for her own she knew she could have loved john meredith if if it had been permissible she knew that life would be a blank thing if rejected as lover he refused longer to be a friend she knew that she could be very happy with him and that she could make him happy but between her and happiness stood the prison gate of the promise she had made to ellen years ago rosemary could not remember her father he had died when she was only three years old ellen who had been thirteen remembered him but with no special tenderness he had been a stern reserved man many years older than his fair pretty wife five years later their brother of twelve died also since his death the two girls had always lived alone with their mother they had never mingled very freely in the social life of the glen or lowbridge though where they went the wit and spirit of ellen and the sweetness and beauty of rosemary made them welcome guests both had what was called a disappointment in their girlhood the sea had not given up rosemarys lover and norman douglas then a handsome red haired young giant noted for wild driving and noisy though harmless escapades had quarrelled with ellen and left her in a fit of pique  there were not lacking candidates for both martins and normans places but none seemed to find favour in the eyes of the west girls who drifted slowly out of youth and bellehood without any seeming regret they were devoted to their mother who was a chronic invalid the three had a little circle of home interests books and pets and flowers which made them happy and contented  mrs wests death which occurred on rosemarys twenty fifth birthday was a bitter grief to them at first they were intolerably lonely ellen especially continued to grieve and brood her long moody musings broken only by fits of stormy passionate weeping the old lowbridge doctor told rosemary that he feared permanent melancholy or worse  once when ellen had sat all day refusing either to speak or eat rosemary had flung herself on her knees by her sisters side  oh ellen you have me yet she said imploringly am i nothing to you we have always loved each other so  i wont have you always ellen had said breaking her silence with harsh intensity you will marry and leave me i shall be left all alone i cannot bear the thought i cannot i would rather die  i will never marry said rosemary never ellen  ellen bent forward and looked searchingly into rosemarys eyes  will you promise me that solemnly she said promise it on mothers bible  rosemary assented at once quite willing to humour ellen what did it matter she knew quite well she would never want to marry any one her love had gone down with martin crawford to the deeps of the sea and without love she could not marry any one so she promised readily though ellen made rather a fearsome rite of it they clasped hands over the bible in their mothers vacant room and both vowed to each other that they would never marry and would always live together  ellens condition improved from that hour she soon regained her normal cheery poise for ten years she and rosemary lived in the old house happily undisturbed by any thought of marrying or giving in marriage their promise sat very lightly on them ellen never failed to remind her sister of it whenever any eligible male creature crossed their paths but she had never been really alarmed until john meredith came home that night with rosemary as for rosemary ellens obsession regarding that promise had always been a little matter of mirth to her until lately now it was a merciless fetter self imposed but never to be shaken off because of it to night she must turn her face from happiness  it was true that the shy sweet rosebud love she had given to her boy lover she could never give to another but she knew now that she could give to john meredith a love richer and more womanly she knew that he touched deeps in her nature that martin had never touched that had not perhaps been in the girl of seventeen to touch and she must send him away to night send him back to his lonely hearth and his empty life and his heart breaking problems because she had promised ellen ten years before on their mothers bible that she would never marry  john meredith did not immediately grasp his opportunity on the contrary he talked for two good hours on the least lover like of subjects he even tried politics though politics always bored rosemary the later began to think that she had been altogether mistaken and her fears and expectations suddenly seemed to her grotesque she felt flat and foolish the glow went out of her face and the lustre out of her eyes john meredith had not the slightest intention of asking her to marry him  and then quite suddenly he rose came across the room and standing by her chair he asked it the room had grown terribly still even st george ceased to purr rosemary heard her own heart beating and was sure john meredith must hear it too  now was the time for her to say no gently but firmly she had been ready for days with her stilted regretful little formula and now the words of it had completely vanished from her mind she had to say no and she suddenly found she could not say it it was the impossible word she knew now that it was not that she could have loved john meredith but that she did love him the thought of putting him from her life was agony  she must say something she lifted her bowed golden head and asked him stammeringly to give her a few days for for consideration  john meredith was a little surprised he was not vainer than any man has a right to be but he had expected that rosemary west would say yes he had been tolerably sure she cared for him then why this doubt this hesitation she was not a school girl to be uncertain as to her own mind he felt an ugly shock of disappointment and dismay but he assented to her request with his unfailing gentle courtesy and went away at once  i will tell you in a few days said rosemary with downcast eyes and burning face  when the door shut behind him she went back into the room and wrung her hands     chapter xxii st george knows all about it   at midnight ellen west was walking home from the pollock silver wedding she had stayed a little while after the other guests had gone to help the gray haired bride wash the dishes the distance between the two houses was not far and the road good so that ellen was enjoying the walk back home in the moonlight  the evening had been a pleasant one ellen who had not been to a party for years found it very pleasant all the guests had been members of her old set and there was no intrusive youth to spoil the flavour for the only son of the bride and groom was far away at college and could not be present norman douglas had been there and they had met socially for the first time in years though she had seen him once or twice in church that winter not the least sentiment was awakened in ellens heart by their meeting she was accustomed to wonder when she thought about it at all how she could ever have fancied him or felt so badly over his sudden marriage but she had rather liked meeting him again she had forgotten how bracing and stimulating he could be no gathering was ever stagnant when norman douglas was present everybody had been surprised when norman came it was well known he never went anywhere the pollocks had invited him because he had been one of the original guests but they never thought he would come he had taken his second cousin amy annetta douglas out to supper and seemed rather attentive to her but ellen sat across the table from him and had a spirited argument with him an argument during which all his shouting and banter could not fluster her and in which she came off best flooring norman so composedly and so completely that he was silent for ten minutes at the end of which time he had muttered in his ruddy beard spunky as ever spunky as ever and began to hector amy annetta who giggled foolishly over his sallies where ellen would have retorted bitingly  ellen thought these things over as she walked home tasting them with reminiscent relish the moonlit air sparkled with frost the snow crisped under her feet below her lay the glen with the white harbour beyond there was a light in the manse study so john meredith had gone home had he asked rosemary to marry him and after what fashion had she made her refusal known ellen felt that she would never know this though she was quite curious she was sure rosemary would never tell her anything about it and she would not dare to ask she must just be content with the fact of the refusal after all that was the only thing that really mattered  i hope hell have sense enough to come back once in a while and be friendly she said to herself she disliked so much to be alone that thinking aloud was one of her devices for circumventing unwelcome solitude its awful never to have a man body with some brains to talk to once in a while and like as not hell never come near the house again theres norman douglas too i like that man and id like to have a good rousing argument with him now and then but hed never dare come up for fear people would think he was courting me again for fear id think it too most likely though hes more a stranger to me now than john meredith it seems like a dream that we could ever have been beaus but there it is theres only two men in the glen id ever want to talk to and what with gossip and this wretched love making business its not likely ill ever see either of them again i could said ellen addressing the unmoved stars with a spiteful emphasis i could have made a better world myself  she paused at her gate with a sudden vague feeling of alarm there was still a light in the living room and to and fro across the window shades went the shadow of a woman walking restlessly up and down what was rosemary doing up at this hour of the night and why was she striding about like a lunatic  ellen went softly in as she opened the hall door rosemary came out of the room she was flushed and breathless an atmosphere of stress and passion hung about her like a garment  why arent you in bed rosemary demanded ellen  come in here said rosemary intensely i want to tell you something  ellen composedly removed her wraps and overshoes and followed her sister into the warm fire lighted room she stood with her hand on the table and waited she was looking very handsome herself in her own grim black browed style the new black velvet dress with its train and v neck which she had made purposely for the party became her stately massive figure she wore coiled around her neck the rich heavy necklace of amber beads which was a family heirloom her walk in the frosty air had stung her cheeks into a glowing scarlet but her steel blue eyes were as icy and unyielding as the sky of the winter night she stood waiting in a silence which rosemary could break only by a convulsive effort  ellen mr meredith was here this evening  yes  and and he asked me to marry him  so i expected of course you refused him  no  rosemary ellen clenched her hands and took an involuntary step forward do you mean to tell me that you accepted him  no no  ellen recovered her self command  what did you do then  i i asked him to give me a few days to think it over  i hardly see why that was necessary said ellen coldly contemptuous when there is only the one answer you can make him  rosemary held out her hands beseechingly  ellen she said desperately i love john meredith i want to be his wife will you set me free from that promise  no said ellen merciless because she was sick from fear  ellen ellen   listen interrupted ellen i did not ask you for that promise you offered it  i know i know but i did not think then that i could ever care for anyone again  you offered it went on ellen unmovably you promised it over our mothers bible it was more than a promise it was an oath now you want to break it  i only asked you to set me free from it ellen  i will not do it a promise is a promise in my eyes i will not do it break your promise be forsworn if you will but it shall not be with any assent of mine  you are very hard on me ellen  hard on you and what of me have you ever given a thought to what my loneliness would be here if you left me i could not bear it i would go crazy i cannot live alone havent i been a good sister to you have i ever opposed any wish of yours havent i indulged you in everything  yes yes  then why do you want to leave me for this man whom you hadnt seen a year ago  i love him ellen  love you talk like a school miss instead of a middle aged woman he doesnt love you he wants a housekeeper and a governess you dont love him you want to be ‘mrs you are one of those weak minded women who think its a disgrace to be ranked as an old maid thats all there is to it  rosemary quivered ellen could not or would not understand there was no use arguing with her  so you wont release me ellen  no i wont and i wont talk of it again you promised and youve got to keep your word thats all go to bed look at the time youre all romantic and worked up to morrow youll be more sensible at any rate dont let me hear any more of this nonsense go  rosemary went without another word pale and spiritless ellen walked stormily about the room for a few minutes then paused before the chair where st george had been calmly sleeping through the whole evening a reluctant smile overspread her dark face there had been only one time in her life the time of her mothers death when ellen had not been able to temper tragedy with comedy even in that long ago bitterness when norman douglas had after a fashion jilted her she had laughed at herself quite as often as she had cried  i expect therell be some sulking st george yes saint i expect we are in for a few unpleasant foggy days well well weather them through george weve dealt with foolish children before saint rosemaryll sulk a while and then shell get over it and all will be as before george she promised and shes got to keep her promise and thats the last word on the subject ill say to you or her or anyone saint  but ellen lay savagely awake till morning  there was no sulking however rosemary was pale and quiet the next day but beyond that ellen could detect no difference in her certainly she seemed to bear ellen no grudge it was stormy so no mention was made of going to church in the afternoon rosemary shut herself in her room and wrote a note to john meredith she could not trust herself to say no in person she felt quite sure that if he suspected she was saying no reluctantly he would not take it for an answer and she could not face pleading or entreaty she must make him think she cared nothing at all for him and she could do that only by letter she wrote him the stiffest coolest little refusal imaginable it was barely courteous it certainly left no loophole of hope for the boldest lover and john meredith was anything but that he shrank into himself hurt and mortified when he read rosemarys letter next day in his dusty study but under his mortification a dreadful realization presently made itself felt he had thought he did not love rosemary as deeply as he had loved cecilia now when he had lost her he knew that he did she was everything to him everything and he must put her out of his life completely even friendship was impossible now life stretched before him in intolerable dreariness he must go on there was his work his children but the heart had gone out of him he sat alone all that evening in his dark cold comfortless study with his head bowed on his hands up on the hill rosemary had a headache and went early to bed while ellen remarked to st george purring his disdain of foolish humankind who did not know that a soft cushion was the only thing that really mattered  what would women do if headaches had never been invented st george but never mind saint well just wink the other eye for a few weeks i admit i dont feel comfortable myself george i feel as if i had drowned a kitten but she promised saint and she was the one to offer it george bismillah     chapter xxiii the good conduct club   a light rain had been falling all day a little delicate beautiful spring rain that somehow seemed to hint and whisper of mayflowers and wakening violets the harbour and the gulf and the low lying shore fields had been dim with pearl gray mists but now in the evening the rain had ceased and the mists had blown out to sea clouds sprinkled the sky over the harbour like little fiery roses beyond it the hills were dark against a spendthrift splendour of daffodil and crimson a great silvery evening star was watching over the bar a brisk dancing new sprung wind was blowing up from rainbow valley resinous with the odours of fir and damp mosses it crooned in the old spruces around the graveyard and ruffled faiths splendid curls as she sat on hezekiah pollocks tombstone with her arms round mary vance and una carl and jerry were sitting opposite them on another tombstone and all were rather full of mischief after being cooped up all day  the air just shines to night doesnt it its been washed so clean you see said faith happily  mary vance eyed her gloomily knowing what she knew or fancied she knew mary considered that faith was far too light hearted mary had something on her mind to say and she meant to say it before she went home mrs elliott had sent her up to the manse with some new laid eggs and had told her not to stay longer than half an hour the half hour was nearly up so mary uncurled her cramped legs from under her and said abruptly  never mind about the air just you listen to me you manse young ones have just got to behave yourselves better than youve been doing this spring thats all there is to it i just come up to night a purpose to tell you so the way people are talking about you is awful  what have we been doing now cried faith in amazement pulling her arm away from mary unas lips trembled and her sensitive little soul shrank within her mary was always so brutally frank jerry began to whistle out of bravado he meant to let mary see he didnt care for her tirades their behaviour was no business of hers anyway what right had she to lecture them on their conduct  doing now youre doing all the time retorted mary just as soon as the talk about one of your didos fades away you do something else to start it up again it seems to me you havent any idea of how manse children ought to behave  maybe you can tell us said jerry killingly sarcastic  sarcasm was quite thrown away on mary  i can tell you what will happen if you dont learn to behave yourselves the session will ask your father to resign there now master jerry know it all mrs alec davis said so to mrs elliott i heard her i always have my ears pricked up when mrs alec davis comes to tea she said you were all going from bad to worse and that though it was only what was to be expected when you had nobody to bring you up still the congregation couldnt be expected to put up with it much longer and something would have to be done the methodists just laugh and laugh at you and that hurts the presbyterian feelings she says you all need a good dose of birch tonic lor if that would make folks good i oughter be a young saint im not telling you this because i want to hurt your feelings im sorry for you mary was past mistress of the gentle art of condescension i understand that you havent much chance the way things are but other people dont make as much allowance as i do miss drew says carl had a frog in his pocket in sunday school last sunday and it hopped out while she was hearing the lesson she says shes going to give up the class why dont you keep your insecks home  i popped it right back in again said carl it didnt hurt anybody a poor little frog and i wish old jane drew would give up our class i hate her her own nephew had a dirty plug of tobacco in his pocket and offered us fellows a chew when elder clow was praying i guess thats worse than a frog  no ‘cause frogs are more unexpected like they make more of a sensation ‘sides he wasnt caught at it and then that praying competition you had last week has made a fearful scandal everybody is talking about it  why the blythes were in that as well as us cried faith indignantly it was nan blythe who suggested it in the first place and walter took the prize  well you get the credit of it any way it wouldnt have been so bad if you hadnt had it in the graveyard  i should think a graveyard was a very good place to pray in retorted jerry  deacon hazard drove past when you were praying said mary and he saw and heard you with your hands folded over your stomach and groaning after every sentence he thought you were making fun of him  so i was declared unabashed jerry only i didnt know he was going by of course that was just a mean accident i wasnt praying in real earnest i knew i had no chance of winning the prize so i was just getting what fun i could out of it walter blythe can pray bully why he can pray as well as dad  una is the only one of us who really likes praying said faith pensively  well if praying scandalizes people so much we mustnt do it any more sighed una  shucks you can pray all you want to only not in the graveyard and dont make a game of it that was what made it so bad that and having a tea party on the tombstones  we hadnt  well a soap bubble party then you had something the over harbour people swear you had a tea party but im willing to take your word and you used this tombstone as a table  well martha wouldnt let us blow bubbles in the house she was awful cross that day explained jerry and this old slab made such a jolly table  werent they pretty cried faith her eyes sparkling over the remembrance they reflected the trees and the hills and the harbour like little fairy worlds and when we shook them loose they floated away down to rainbow valley  all but one and it went over and bust up on the methodist spire said carl  im glad we did it once anyhow before we found out it was wrong said faith  it wouldnt have been wrong to blow them on the lawn said mary impatiently seems like i cant knock any sense into your heads youve been told often enough you shouldnt play in the graveyard the methodists are sensitive about it  we forget said faith dolefully and the lawn is so small and so caterpillary and so full of shrubs and things we cant be in rainbow valley all the time and where are we to go  its the things you do in the graveyard it wouldnt matter if you just sat here and talked quiet same as were doing now well i dont know what is going to come of it all but i do know that elder warren is going to speak to your pa about it deacon hazard is his cousin  i wish they wouldnt bother father about us said una  well people think he ought to bother himself about you a little more i dont i understand him hes a child in some ways himself thats what he is and needs some one to look after him as bad as you do well perhaps hell have some one before long if all tales is true  what do you mean asked faith  havent you got any idea honest demanded mary  no no what do you mean  well you are a lot of innocents upon my word why everybody is talking of it your pa goes to see rosemary west she is going to be your step ma  i dont believe it cried una flushing crimson  well i dunno i just go by what folks say i dont give it for a fact but it would be a good thing rosemary westd make you toe the mark if she came here ill bet a cent for all shes so sweet and smiley on the face of her theyre always that way till theyve caught them but you need some one to bring you up youre disgracing your pa and i feel for him ive always thought an awful lot of your pa ever since that night he talked to me so nice ive never said a single swear word since or told a lie and id like to see him happy and comfortable with his buttons on and his meals decent and you young ones licked into shape and that old cat of a martha put in her proper place the way she looked at the eggs i brought her to night ‘i hope theyre fresh says she i just wished they was rotten but you just mind that she gives you all one for breakfast including your pa make a fuss if she doesnt that was what they was sent up for but i dont trust old martha shes quite capable of feeding ‘em to her cat  marys tongue being temporarily tired a brief silence fell over the graveyard the manse children did not feel like talking they were digesting the new and not altogether palatable ideas mary had suggested to them jerry and carl were somewhat startled but after all what did it matter and it wasnt likely there was a word of truth in it faith on the whole was pleased only una was seriously upset she felt that she would like to get away and cry  will there be any stars in my crown sang the methodist choir beginning to practise in the methodist church  i want just three said mary whose theological knowledge had increased notably since her residence with mrs elliott just three setting up on my head like a corownet a big one in the middle and a small one each side  are there different sizes in souls asked carl  of course why little babies must have smaller ones than big men well its getting dark and i must scoot home mrs elliott doesnt like me to be out after dark laws when i lived with mrs wiley the dark was just the same as the daylight to me i didnt mind it no moren a gray cat them days seem a hundred years ago now you mind what ive said and try to behave yourselves for you pas sake ill always back you up and defend you you can be dead sure of that mrs elliott says she never saw the like of me for sticking up for my friends i was real sassy to mrs alec davis about you and mrs elliott combed me down for it afterwards the fair cornelia has a tongue of her own and no mistake but she was pleased underneath for all ‘cause she hates old kitty alec and shes real fond of you i can see through folks  mary sailed off excellently well pleased with herself leaving a rather depressed little group behind her  mary vance always says something that makes us feel bad when she comes up said una resentfully  i wish wed left her to starve in the old barn said jerry vindictively  oh thats wicked jerry rebuked una  may as well have the game as the name retorted unrepentant jerry if people say were so bad lets be bad  but not if it hurts father pleaded faith  jerry squirmed uncomfortably he adored his father through the unshaded study window they could see mr meredith at his desk he did not seem to be either reading or writing his head was in his hands and there was something in his whole attitude that spoke of weariness and dejection the children suddenly felt it  i dare say somebodys been worrying him about us to day said faith i wish we could get along without making people talk oh jem blythe how you scared me  jem blythe had slipped into the graveyard and sat down beside the girls he had been prowling about rainbow valley and had succeeded in finding the first little star white cluster of arbutus for his mother the manse children were rather silent after his coming jem was beginning to grow away from them somewhat this spring he was studying for the entrance examination of queens academy and stayed after school with the older pupils for extra lessons also his evenings were so full of work that he seldom joined the others in rainbow valley now he seemed to be drifting away into grown up land  what is the matter with you all to night he asked theres no fun in you  not much agreed faith dolefully there wouldnt be much fun in you either if you knew you were disgracing your father and making people talk about you  whos been talking about you now  everybody so mary vance says and faith poured out her troubles to sympathetic jem you see she concluded dolefully weve nobody to bring us up and so we get into scrapes and people think were bad  why dont you bring yourselves up suggested jem ill tell you what to do form a good conduct club and punish yourselves every time you do anything thats not right  thats a good idea said faith struck by it but she added doubtfully things that dont seem a bit of harm to us seem simply dreadful to other people how can we tell we cant be bothering father all the time and he has to be away a lot anyhow  you could mostly tell if you stopped to think a thing over before doing it and ask yourselves what the congregation would say about it said jem the trouble is you just rush into things and dont think them over at all mother says youre all too impulsive just as she used to be the good conduct club would help you to think if you were fair and honest about punishing yourselves when you broke the rules youd have to punish in some way that really hurt or it wouldnt do any good  whip each other  not exactly youd have to think up different ways of punishment to suit the person you wouldnt punish each other youd punish yourselves i read all about such a club in a story book you try it and see how it works  lets said faith and when jem was gone they agreed they would if things arent right weve just got to make them right said faith resolutely  weve got to be fair and square as jem says said jerry this is a club to bring ourselves up seeing theres nobody else to do it theres no use in having many rules lets just have one and any of us that breaks it has got to be punished hard  but how  well think that up as we go along well hold a session of the club here in the graveyard every night and talk over what weve done through the day and if we think weve done anything that isnt right or that would disgrace dad the one that does it or is responsible for it must be punished thats the rule well all decide on the kind of punishment it must be made to fit the crime as mr flagg says and the one thats guilty will be bound to carry it out and no shirking theres going to be fun in this concluded jerry with a relish  you suggested the soap bubble party said faith  but that was before wed formed the club said jerry hastily everything starts from to night  but what if we cant agree on whats right or what the punishment ought to be spose two of us thought of one thing and two another there ought to be five in a club like this  we can ask jem blythe to be umpire he is the squarest boy in glen st mary but i guess we can settle our own affairs mostly we want to keep this as much of a secret as we can dont breathe a word to mary vance shed want to join and do the bringing up  i think said faith that theres no use in spoiling every day by dragging punishments in lets have a punishment day  wed better choose saturday because there is no school to interfere suggested una  and spoil the one holiday in the week cried faith not much no lets take friday thats fish day anyhow and we all hate fish we may as well have all the disagreeable things in one day then other days we can go ahead and have a good time  nonsense said jerry authoritatively such a scheme wouldnt work at all well just punish ourselves as we go along and keep a clear slate now we all understand dont we this is a good conduct club for the purpose of bringing ourselves up we agree to punish ourselves for bad conduct and always to stop before we do anything no matter what and ask ourselves if it is likely to hurt dad in any way and any one who shirks is to be cast out of the club and never allowed to play with the rest of us in rainbow valley again jem blythe to be umpire in case of disputes no more taking bugs to sunday school carl and no more chewing gum in public if you please miss faith  no more making fun of elders praying or going to the methodist prayer meeting retorted faith  why it isnt any harm to go to the methodist prayer meeting protested jerry in amazement  mrs elliott says it is she says manse children have no business to go anywhere but to presbyterian things  darn it i wont give up going to the methodist prayer meeting cried jerry its ten times more fun than ours is  you said a naughty word cried faith now youve got to punish yourself  not till its all down in black and white were only talking the club over it isnt really formed until weve written it out and signed it theres got to be a constitution and by laws and you know theres nothing wrong in going to a prayer meeting  but its not only the wrong things were to punish ourselves for but anything that might hurt father  it wont hurt anybody you know mrs elliott is cracked on the subject of methodists nobody else makes any fuss about my going i always behave myself you ask jem or mrs blythe and see what they say ill abide by their opinion im going for the paper now and ill bring out the lantern and well all sign  fifteen minutes later the document was solemnly signed on hezekiah pollocks tombstone on the centre of which stood the smoky manse lantern while the children knelt around it mrs elder clow was going past at the moment and next day all the glen heard that the manse children had been having another praying competition and had wound it up by chasing each other all over the graves with a lantern this piece of embroidery was probably suggested by the fact that after the signing and sealing was completed carl had taken the lantern and had walked circumspectly to the little hollow to examine his ant hill the others had gone quietly into the manse and to bed  do you think it is true that father is going to marry miss west una had tremulously asked of faith after their prayers had been said  i dont know but id like it said faith  oh i wouldnt said una chokingly she is nice the way she is but mary vance says it changes people altogether to be made stepmothers they get horrid cross and mean and hateful then and turn your father against you she says theyre sure to do that she never knew it to fail in a single case  i dont believe miss west would ever try to do that cried faith  mary says anybody would she knows all about stepmothers faith she says shes seen hundreds of them and youve never seen one oh mary has told me blood curdling things about them she says she knew of one who whipped her husbands little girls on their bare shoulders till they bled and then shut them up in a cold dark coal cellar all night she says theyre all aching to do things like that  i dont believe miss west would you dont know her as well as i do una just think of that sweet little bird she sent me i love it far more even than adam  its just being a stepmother changes them mary says they cant help it i wouldnt mind the whippings so much as having father hate us  you know nothing could make father hate us dont be silly una i dare say theres nothing to worry over likely if we run our club right and bring ourselves up properly father wont think of marrying any one and if he does i know miss west will be lovely to us  but una had no such conviction and she cried herself to sleep     chapter xxiv a charitable impulse   for a fortnight things ran smoothly in the good conduct club it seemed to work admirably not once was jem blythe called in as umpire not once did any of the manse children set the glen gossips by the ears as for their minor peccadilloes at home they kept sharp tabs on each other and gamely underwent their self imposed punishment generally a voluntary absence from some gay friday night frolic in rainbow valley or a sojourn in bed on some spring evening when all young bones ached to be out and away faith for whispering in sunday school condemned herself to pass a whole day without speaking a single word unless it was absolutely necessary and accomplished it it was rather unfortunate that mr baker from over harbour should have chosen that evening for calling at the manse and that faith should have happened to go to the door not one word did she reply to his genial greeting but went silently away to call her father briefly mr baker was slightly offended and told his wife when he went home that that the biggest meredith girl seemed a very shy sulky little thing without manners enough to speak when she was spoken to but nothing worse came of it and generally their penances did no harm to themselves or anybody else all of them were beginning to feel quite cocksure that after all it was a very easy matter to bring yourself up  i guess people will soon see that we can behave ourselves properly as well as anybody said faith jubilantly it isnt hard when we put our minds to it  she and una were sitting on the pollock tombstone it had been a cold raw wet day of spring storm and rainbow valley was out of the question for girls though the manse and the ingleside boys were down there fishing the rain had held up but the east wind blew mercilessly in from the sea cutting to bone and marrow spring was late in spite of its early promise and there was even yet a hard drift of old snow and ice in the northern corner of the graveyard lida marsh who had come up to bring the manse a mess of herring slipped in through the gate shivering she belonged to the fishing village at the harbour mouth and her father had for thirty years made a practice of sending a mess from his first spring catch to the manse he never darkened a church door he was a hard drinker and a reckless man but as long as he sent those herring up to the manse every spring as his father had done before him he felt comfortably sure that his account with the powers that govern was squared for the year he would not have expected a good mackerel catch if he had not so sent the first fruits of the season  lida was a mite of ten and looked younger because she was such a small wizened little creature to night as she sidled boldly enough up to the manse girls she looked as if she had never been warm since she was born her face was purple and her pale blue bold little eyes were red and watery she wore a tattered print dress and a ragged woollen comforter tied across her thin shoulders and under her arms she had walked the three miles from the harbour mouth barefooted over a road where there was still snow and slush and mud her feet and legs were as purple as her face but lida did not mind this much she was used to being cold and she had been going barefooted for a month already like all the other swarming young fry of the fishing village there was no self pity in her heart as she sat down on the tombstone and grinned cheerfully at faith and una faith and una grinned cheerfully back they knew lida slightly having met her once or twice the preceding summer when they had gone down the harbour with the blythes  hello said lida aint this a fierce kind of a night ‘taint fit for a dog to be out is it  then why are you out asked faith  pa made me bring you up some herring returned lida she shivered coughed and stuck out her bare feet lida was not thinking about herself or her feet and was making no bid for sympathy she held her feet out instinctively to keep them from the wet grass around the tombstone but faith and una were instantly swamped with a wave of pity for her she looked so cold so miserable  oh why are you barefooted on such a cold night cried faith your feet must be almost frozen  pretty near said lida proudly i tell you it was fierce walking up that harbour road  why didnt you put on your shoes and stockings asked una  haint none to put on all i had was wore out by the time winter was over said lida indifferently  for a moment faith stated in horror this was terrible here was a little girl almost a neighbour half frozen because she had no shoes or stockings in this cruel spring weather impulsive faith thought of nothing but the dreadfulness of it in a moment she was pulling off her own shoes and stockings  here take these and put them right on she said forcing them into the hands of the astonished lida quick now youll catch your death of cold ive got others put them right on  lida recovering her wits snatched at the offered gift with a sparkle in her dull eyes sure she would put them on and that mighty quick before any one appeared with authority to recall them in a minute she had pulled the stockings over her scrawny little legs and slipped faiths shoes over her thick little ankles  im obliged to you she said but wont your folks be cross  no and i dont care if they are said faith do you think i could see any one freezing to death without helping them if i could it wouldnt be right especially when my fathers a minister  will you want them back its awful cold down at the harbour mouth long after its warm up here said lida slyly  no youre to keep them of course that is what i meant when i gave them i have another pair of shoes and plenty of stockings  lida had meant to stay awhile and talk to the girls about many things but now she thought she had better get away before somebody came and made her yield up her booty so she shuffled off through the bitter twilight in the noiseless shadowy way she had slipped in as soon as she was out of sight of the manse she sat down took off the shoes and stockings and put them in her herring basket she had no intention of keeping them on down that dirty harbour road they were to be kept good for gala occasions not another little girl down at the harbour mouth had such fine black cashmere stockings and such smart almost new shoes lida was furnished forth for the summer she had no qualms in the matter in her eyes the manse people were quite fabulously rich and no doubt those girls had slathers of shoes and stockings then lida ran down to the glen village and played for an hour with the boys before mr flaggs store splashing about in a pool of slush with the maddest of them until mrs elliott came along and bade her begone home  i dont think faith that you should have done that said una a little reproachfully after lida had gone youll have to wear your good boots every day now and theyll soon scuff out  i dont care cried faith still in the fine glow of having done a kindness to a fellow creature it isnt fair that i should have two pairs of shoes and poor little lida marsh not have any now we both have a pair you know perfectly well una that father said in his sermon last sunday that there was no real happiness in getting or having only in giving and its true i feel far happier now than i ever did in my whole life before just think of lida walking home this very minute with her poor little feet all nice and warm and comfy  you know you havent another pair of black cashmere stockings said una your other pair were so full of holes that aunt martha said she couldnt darn them any more and she cut the legs up for stove dusters youve nothing but those two pairs of striped stockings you hate so  all the glow and uplift went out of faith her gladness collapsed like a pricked balloon she sat for a few dismal minutes in silence facing the consequences of her rash act  oh una i never thought of that she said dolefully i didnt stop to think at all  the striped stockings were thick heavy coarse ribbed stockings of blue and red which aunt martha had knit for faith in the winter they were undoubtedly hideous faith loathed them as she had never loathed anything before wear them she certainly would not they were still unworn in her bureau drawer  youll have to wear the striped stockings after this said una just think how the boys in school will laugh at you you know how they laugh at mamie warren for her striped stockings and call her barber pole and yours are far worse  i wont wear them said faith ill go barefooted first cold as it is  you cant go barefooted to church to morrow think what people would say  then ill stay home  you cant you know very well aunt martha will make you go  faith did know this the one thing on which aunt martha troubled herself to insist was that they must all go to church rain or shine how they were dressed or if they were dressed at all never concerned her but go they must that was how aunt martha had been brought up seventy years ago and that was how she meant to bring them up  havent you got a pair you can lend me una said poor faith piteously  una shook her head no you know i only have the one black pair and theyre so tight i can hardly get them on they wouldnt go on you neither would my gray ones besides the legs of them are all darned and darned  i wont wear those striped stockings said faith stubbornly the feel of them is even worse than the looks they make me feel as if my legs were as big as barrels and theyre so scratchy  well i dont know what youre going to do  if father was home id go and ask him to get me a new pair before the store closes but he wont be home till too late ill ask him monday and i wont go to church tomorrow ill pretend im sick and aunt marthall have to let me stay home  that would be acting a lie faith cried una you cant do that you know it would be dreadful what would father say if he knew dont you remember how he talked to us after mother died and told us we must always be true no matter what else we failed in he said we must never tell or act a lie he said hed trust us not to you cant do it faith just wear the striped stockings itll only be for once nobody will notice them in church it isnt like school and your new brown dress is so long they wont show much wasnt it lucky aunt martha made it big so youd have room to grow in it for all you hated it so when she finished it  i wont wear those stockings repeated faith she uncoiled her bare white legs from the tombstone and deliberately walked through the wet cold grass to the bank of snow setting her teeth she stepped upon it and stood there  what are you doing cried una aghast youll catch your death of cold faith meredith  im trying to answered faith i hope ill catch a fearful cold and be awful sick to morrow then i wont be acting a lie im going to stand here as long as i can bear it  but faith you might really die you might get pneumonia please faith dont lets go into the house and get something for your feet oh heres jerry im so thankful jerry make faith get off that snow look at her feet  holy cats faith what are you doing demanded jerry are you crazy  no go away snapped faith  then are you punishing yourself for something it isnt right if you are youll be sick  i want to be sick im not punishing myself go away  wheres her shoes and stockings asked jerry of una  she gave them to lida marsh  lida marsh what for  because lida had none and her feet were so cold and now she wants to be sick so that she wont have to go to church to morrow and wear her striped stockings but jerry she may die  faith said jerry get off that ice bank or ill pull you off  pull away dared faith  jerry sprang at her and caught her arms he pulled one way and faith pulled another una ran behind faith and pushed faith stormed at jerry to leave her alone jerry stormed back at her not to be a dizzy idiot and una cried they made no end of noise and they were close to the road fence of the graveyard henry warren and his wife drove by and heard and saw them very soon the glen heard that the manse children had been having an awful fight in the graveyard and using most improper language meanwhile faith had allowed herself to be pulled off the ice because her feet were aching so sharply that she was ready to get off any way they all went in amiably and went to bed faith slept like a cherub and woke in the morning without a trace of a cold she felt that she couldnt feign sickness and act a lie after remembering that long ago talk with her father but she was still as fully determined as ever that she would not wear those abominable stockings to church     chapter xxv another scandal and another explanation   faith went early to sunday school and was seated in the corner of her class pew before any one came therefore the dreadful truth did not burst upon any one until faith left the class pew near the door to walk up to the manse pew after sunday school the church was already half filled and all who were sitting near the aisle saw that the ministers daughter had boots on but no stockings  faiths new brown dress which aunt martha had made from an ancient pattern was absurdly long for her but even so it did not meet her boot tops two good inches of bare white leg showed plainly  faith and carl sat alone in the manse pew jerry had gone into the gallery to sit with a chum and the blythe girls had taken una with them the meredith children were given to sitting all over the church in this fashion and a great many people thought it very improper the gallery especially where irresponsible lads congregated and were known to whisper and suspected of chewing tobacco during service was no place for a son of the manse but jerry hated the manse pew at the very top of the church under the eyes of elder clow and his family he escaped from it whenever he could  carl absorbed in watching a spider spinning its web at the window did not notice faiths legs she walked home with her father after church and he never noticed them she got on the hated striped stockings before jerry and una arrived so that for the time being none of the occupants of the manse knew what she had done but nobody else in glen st mary was ignorant of it the few who had not seen soon heard nothing else was talked of on the way home from church mrs alec davis said it was only what she expected and the next thing you would see some of those young ones coming to church with no clothes on at all the president of the ladies aid decided that she would bring the matter up at the next aid meeting and suggest that they wait in a body on the minister and protest miss cornelia said that she for her part gave up there was no use worrying over the manse fry any longer even mrs dr blythe felt a little shocked though she attributed the occurrence solely to faiths forgetfulness susan could not immediately begin knitting stockings for faith because it was sunday but she had one set up before any one else was out of bed at ingleside the next morning  you need not tell me anything but that it was old marthas fault mrs dr dear she told anne i suppose that poor little child had no decent stockings to wear i suppose every stocking she had was in holes as you know very well they generally are and i think mrs dr dear that the ladies aid would be better employed in knitting some for them than in fighting over the new carpet for the pulpit platform i am not a ladies aider but i shall knit faith two pairs of stockings out of this nice black yarn as fast as my fingers can move and that you may tie to never shall i forget my sensations mrs dr dear when i saw a ministers child walking up the aisle of our church with no stockings on i really did not know what way to look  and the church was just full of methodists yesterday too groaned miss cornelia who had come up to the glen to do some shopping and run into ingleside to talk the affair over i dont know how it is but just as sure as those manse children do something especially awful the church is sure to be crowded with methodists i thought mrs deacon hazards eyes would drop out of her head when she came out of church she said ‘well that exhibition was no more than decent i do pity the presbyterians and we just had to take it there was nothing one could say  there was something i could have said mrs dr dear if i had heard her said susan grimly i would have said for one thing that in my opinion clean bare legs were quite as decent as holes and i would have said for another that the presbyterians did not feel greatly in need of pity seeing that they had a minister who could preach and the methodists had not i could have squelched mrs deacon hazard mrs dr dear and that you may tie to  i wish mr meredith didnt preach quite so well and looked after his family a little better retorted miss cornelia he could at least glance over his children before they went to church and see that they were quite properly clothed im tired making excuses for him believe me  meanwhile faiths soul was being harrowed up in rainbow valley mary vance was there and as usual in a lecturing mood she gave faith to understand that she had disgraced herself and her father beyond redemption and that she mary vance was done with her everybody was talking and everybody said the same thing  i simply feel that i cant associate with you any longer she concluded  we are going to associate with her then cried nan blythe nan secretly thought faith had done a awful thing but she wasnt going to let mary vance run matters in this high handed fashion and if you are not you neednt come any more to rainbow valley miss vance  nan and di both put their arms around faith and glared defiance at mary the latter suddenly crumpled up sat down on a stump and began to cry  it aint that i dont want to she wailed but if i keep in with faith peoplell be saying i put her up to doing things some are saying it now trues you live i cant afford to have such things said of me now that im in a respectable place and trying to be a lady and i never went bare legged in church in my toughest days id never have thought of doing such a thing but that hateful old kitty alec says faith has never been the same girl since that time i stayed in the manse she says cornelia elliott will live to rue the day she took me in it hurts my feelings i tell you but its mr meredith im really worried over  i think you neednt worry about him said di scornfully it isnt likely necessary now faith darling stop crying and tell us why you did it  faith explained tearfully the blythe girls sympathized with her and even mary vance agreed that it was a hard position to be in but jerry on whom the thing came like a thunderbolt refused to be placated so this was what some mysterious hints he had got in school that day meant he marched faith and una home without ceremony and the good conduct club held an immediate session in the graveyard to sit in judgment on faiths case  i dont see that it was any harm said faith defiantly not much of my legs showed it wasnt wrong and it didnt hurt anybody  it will hurt dad you know it will you know people blame him whenever we do anything queer  i didnt think of that muttered faith  thats just the trouble you didnt think and you should have thought thats what our club is for to bring us up and make us think we promised wed always stop and think before doing things you didnt and youve got to be punished faith and real hard too youll wear those striped stockings to school for a week for punishment  oh jerry wont a day do two days not a whole week  yes a whole week said inexorable jerry it is fair ask jem blythe if it isnt  faith felt she would rather submit then ask jem blythe about such a matter she was beginning to realize that her offence was a quite shameful one  ill do it then she muttered a little sulkily  youre getting off easy said jerry severely and no matter how we punish you it wont help father people will always think you just did it for mischief and theyll blame father for not stopping it we can never explain it to everybody  this aspect of the case weighed on faiths mind her own condemnation she could bear but it tortured her that her father should be blamed if people knew the true facts of the case they would not blame him but how could she make them known to all the world getting up in church as she had once done and explaining the matter was out of the question faith had heard from mary vance how the congregation had looked upon that performance and realized that she must not repeat it faith worried over the problem for half a week then she had an inspiration and promptly acted upon it she spent that evening in the garret with a lamp and an exercise book writing busily with flushed cheeks and shining eyes it was the very thing how clever she was to have thought of it it would put everything right and explain everything and yet cause no scandal it was eleven oclock when she had finished to her satisfaction and crept down to bed dreadfully tired but perfectly happy  in a few days the little weekly published in the glen under the name of the journal came out as usual and the glen had another sensation a letter signed faith meredith occupied a prominent place on the front page and ran as follows    to whom it may concern   i want to explain to everybody how it was i came to go to church without stockings on so that everybody will know that father was not to blame one bit for it and the old gossips need not say he is because it is not true i gave my only pair of black stockings to lida marsh because she hadnt any and her poor little feet were awful cold and i was so sorry for her no child ought to have to go without shoes and stockings in a christian community before the snow is all gone and i think the w f m s ought to have given her stockings of course i know they are sending things to the little heathen children and that is all right and a kind thing to do but the little heathen children have lots more warm weather than we have and i think the women of our church ought to look after lida and not leave it all to me when i gave her my stockings i forgot they were the only black pair i had without holes but i am glad i did give them to her because my conscience would have been uncomfortable if i hadnt when she had gone away looking so proud and happy the poor little thing i remembered that all i had to wear were the horrid red and blue things aunt martha knit last winter for me out of some yarn that mrs joseph burr of upper glen sent us it was dreadfully coarse yarn and all knots and i never saw any of mrs burrs own children wearing things made of such yarn but mary vance says mrs burr gives the minister stuff that she cant use or eat herself and thinks it ought to go as part of the salary her husband signed to pay but never does  i just couldnt bear to wear those hateful stockings they were so ugly and rough and felt so scratchy everybody would have made fun of me i thought at first id pretend to be sick and not go to church next day but i decided i couldnt do that because it would be acting a lie and father told us after mother died that was something we must never never do it is just as bad to act a lie as to tell one though i know some people right here in the glen who act them and never seem to feel a bit bad about it i will not mention any names but i know who they are and so does father  then i tried my best to catch cold and really be sick by standing on the snowbank in the methodist graveyard with my bare feet until jerry pulled me off but it didnt hurt me a bit and so i couldnt get out of going to church so i just decided i would put my boots on and go that way i cant see why it was so wrong and i was so careful to wash my legs just as clean as my face but anyway father wasnt to blame for it he was in the study thinking of his sermon and other heavenly things and i kept out of his way before i went to sunday school father does not look at peoples legs in church so of course he did not notice mine but all the gossips did and talked about it and that is why i am writing this letter to the journal to explain i suppose i did very wrong since everybody says so and i am sorry and i am wearing those awful stockings to punish myself although father bought me two nice new black pairs as soon as mr flaggs store opened on monday morning but it was all my fault and if people blame father for it after they read this they are not christians and so i do not mind what they say  there is another thing i want to explain about before i stop mary vance told me that mr evan boyd is blaming the lew baxters for stealing potatoes out of his field last fall they did not touch his potatoes they are very poor but they are honest it was us did it jerry and carl and i una was not with us at the time we never thought it was stealing we just wanted a few potatoes to cook over a fire in rainbow valley one evening to eat with our fried trout mr boyds field was the nearest just between the valley and the village so we climbed over his fence and pulled up some stalks the potatoes were awful small because mr boyd did not put enough fertilizer on them and we had to pull up a lot of stalks before we got enough and then they were not much bigger than marbles walter and di blythe helped us eat them but they did not come along until we had them cooked and did not know where we got them so they were not to blame at all only us we didnt mean any harm but if it was stealing we are very sorry and we will pay mr boyd for them if he will wait until we grow up we never have any money now because we are not big enough to earn any and aunt martha says it takes every cent of poor fathers salary even when it is paid up regularly and it isnt often to run this house but mr boyd must not blame the lew baxters any more when they were quite innocent and give them a bad name  yours respectfully faith meredith     chapter xxvi miss cornelia gets a new point of view   susan after im dead im going to come back to earth every time when the daffodils blow in this garden said anne rapturously nobody may see me but ill be here if anybody is in the garden at the time i think ill come on an evening just like this but it might be just at dawn a lovely pale pinky spring dawn theyll just see the daffodils nodding wildly as if an extra gust of wind had blown past them but it will be i  indeed mrs dr dear you will not be thinking of flaunting worldly things like daffies after you are dead said susan and i do not believe in ghosts seen or unseen  oh susan i shall not be a ghost that has such a horrible sound i shall just be me and i shall run around in the twilight whether it is morn or eve and see all the spots i love do you remember how badly i felt when i left our little house of dreams susan i thought i could never love ingleside so well but i do i love every inch of the ground and every stick and stone on it  i am rather fond of the place myself said susan who would have died if she had been removed from it but we must not set our affections too much on earthly things mrs dr dear there are such things as fires and earthquakes we should always be prepared the tom macallisters over harbour were burned out three nights ago some say tom macallister set the house on fire himself to get the insurance that may or may not be but i advise the doctor to have our chimneys seen to at once an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure but i see mrs marshall elliott coming in at the gate looking as if she had been sent for and couldnt go  anne dearie have you seen the journal to day  miss cornelias voice was trembling partly from emotion partly from the fact that she had hurried up from the store too fast and lost her breath  anne bent over the daffodils to hide a smile she and gilbert had laughed heartily and heartlessly over the front page of the journal that day but she knew that to dear miss cornelia it was almost a tragedy and she must not wound her feelings by any display of levity  isnt it dreadful what is to be done asked miss cornelia despairingly miss cornelia had vowed that she was done with worrying over the pranks of the manse children but she went on worrying just the same  anne led the way to the veranda where susan was knitting with shirley and rilla conning their primers on either side susan was already on her second pair of stockings for faith susan never worried over poor humanity she did what in her lay for its betterment and serenely left the rest to the higher powers  cornelia elliott thinks she was born to run this world mrs dr dear she had once said to anne and so she is always in a stew over something i have never thought i was and so i go calmly along not but what it has sometimes occurred to me that things might be run a little better than they are but it is not for us poor worms to nourish such thoughts they only make us uncomfortable and do not get us anywhere  i dont see that anything can be done now  said anne pulling out a nice cushiony chair for miss cornelia but how in the world did mr vickers allow that letter to be printed surely he should have known better  why hes away anne dearie hes been away to new brunswick for a week and that young scalawag of a joe vickers is editing the journal in his absence of course mr vickers would never have put it in even if he is a methodist but joe would just think it a good joke as you say i dont suppose there is anything to be done now only live it down but if i ever get joe vickers cornered somewhere ill give him a talking to he wont forget in a hurry i wanted marshall to stop our subscription to the journal instantly but he only laughed and said that to days issue was the only one that had had anything readable in it for a year marshall never will take anything seriously just like a man fortunately evan boyd is like that too he takes it as a joke and is laughing all over the place about it and hes another methodist as for mrs burr of upper glen of course she will be furious and they will leave the church not that it will be a great loss from any point of view the methodists are quite welcome to them  it serves mrs burr right said susan who had an old feud with the lady in question and had been hugely tickled over the reference to her in faiths letter she will find that she will not be able to cheat the methodist parson out of his salary with bad yarn  the worst of it is theres not much hope of things getting any better said miss cornelia gloomily as long as mr meredith was going to see rosemary west i did hope the manse would soon have a proper mistress but that is all off i suppose she wouldnt have him on account of the children at least everybody seems to think so  i do not believe that he ever asked her said susan who could not conceive of any one refusing a minister  well nobody knows anything about that but one thing is certain he doesnt go there any longer and rosemary didnt look well all the spring i hope her visit to kingsport will do her good shes been gone for a month and will stay another month i understand i cant remember when rosemary was away from home before she and ellen could never bear to be parted but i understand ellen insisted on her going this time and meanwhile ellen and norman douglas are warming up the old soup  is that really so asked anne laughing i heard a rumour of it but i hardly believed it  believe it you may believe it all right anne dearie nobody is in ignorance of it norman douglas never left anybody in doubt as to his intentions in regard to anything he always did his courting before the public he told marshall that he hadnt thought about ellen for years but the first time he went to church last fall he saw her and fell in love with her all over again he said hed clean forgot how handsome she was he hadnt seen her for twenty years if you can believe it of course he never went to church and ellen never went anywhere else round here oh we all know what norman means but what ellen means is a different matter i shant take it upon me to predict whether it will be a match or not  he jilted her once but it seems that does not count with some people mrs dr dear susan remarked rather acidly  he jilted her in a fit of temper and repented it all his life said miss cornelia that is different from a cold blooded jilting for my part i never detested norman as some folks do he could never over crow me i do wonder what started him coming to church i have never been able to believe mrs wilsonss story that faith meredith went there and bullied him into it ive always intended to ask faith herself but ive never happened to think of it just when i saw her what influence could she have over norman douglas he was in the store when i left bellowing with laughter over that scandalous letter you could have heard him at four winds point ‘the greatest girl in the world he was shouting ‘shes that full of spunk shes bursting with it and all the old grannies want to tame her darn them but theyll never be able to do it never they might as well try to drown a fish boyd see that you put more fertilizer on your potatoes next year ho ho ho and then he laughed till the roof shook  mr douglas pays well to the salary at least remarked susan  oh norman isnt mean in some ways hed give a thousand without blinking a lash and roar like a bull of bashan if he had to pay five cents too much for anything besides he likes mr merediths sermons and norman douglas was always willing to shell out if he got his brains tickled up there is no more christianity about him than there is about a black naked heathen in africa and never will be but hes clever and well read and he judges sermons as he would lectures anyhow its well he backs up mr meredith and the children as he does for theyll need friends more than ever after this i am tired of making excuses for them believe me  do you know dear miss cornelia said anne seriously i think we have all been making too many excuses it is very foolish and we ought to stop it i am going to tell you what id like to do i shant do it of course anne had noted a glint of alarm in susans eye it would be too unconventional and we must be conventional or die after we reach what is supposed to be a dignified age but id like to do it id like to call a meeting of the ladies aid and wms and the girls sewing society and include in the audience all and any methodists who have been criticizing the merediths although i do think if we presbyterians stopped criticizing and excusing we would find that other denominations would trouble themselves very little about our manse folks i would say to them ‘dear christian friends with marked emphasis on ‘christian i have something to say to you and i want to say it good and hard that you may take it home and repeat it to your families you methodists need not pity us and we presbyterians need not pity ourselves we are not going to do it any more and we are going to say boldly and truthfully to all critics and sympathizers ‘we are proud of our minister and his family mr meredith is the best preacher glen st mary church ever had moreover he is a sincere earnest teacher of truth and christian charity he is a faithful friend a judicious pastor in all essentials and a refined scholarly well bred man his family are worthy of him gerald meredith is the cleverest pupil in the glen school and mr hazard says that he is destined to a brilliant career he is a manly honourable truthful little fellow faith meredith is a beauty and as inspiring and original as she is beautiful there is nothing commonplace about her all the other girls in the glen put together havent the vim and wit and joyousness and ‘spunk she has she has not an enemy in the world every one who knows her loves her of how many children or grown ups can that be said una meredith is sweetness personified she will make a most lovable woman carl meredith with his love for ants and frogs and spiders will some day be a naturalist whom all canada nay all the world will delight to honour do you know of any other family in the glen or out of it of whom all these things can be said away with shamefaced excuses and apologies we rejoice in our minister and his splendid boys and girls  anne stopped partly because she was out of breath after her vehement speech and partly because she could not trust herself to speak further in view of miss cornelias face that good lady was staring helplessly at anne apparently engulfed in billows of new ideas but she came up with a gasp and struck out for shore gallantly  anne blythe i wish you would call that meeting and say just that youve made me ashamed of myself for one and far be it from me to refuse to admit it of course that is how we should have talked especially to the methodists and its every word of it true every word weve just been shutting our eyes to the big worth while things and squinting them on the little things that dont really matter a pins worth oh anne dearie i can see a thing when its hammered into my head no more apologizing for cornelia marshall i shall hold my head up after this believe me though i may talk things over with you as usual just to relieve my feelings if the merediths do any more startling stunts even that letter i felt so bad about why its only a good joke after all as norman says not many girls would have been cute enough to think of writing it and all punctuated so nicely and not one word misspelled just let me hear any methodist say one word about it though all the same ill never forgive joe vickers believe me where are the rest of your small fry to night  walter and the twins are in rainbow valley jem is studying in the garret  they are all crazy about rainbow valley mary vance thinks its the only place in the world shed be off up here every evening if id let her but i dont encourage her in gadding besides i miss the creature when she isnt around anne dearie i never thought id get so fond of her not but what i see her faults and try to correct them but she has never said one saucy word to me since she came to my house and she is a great help for when all is said and done anne dearie i am not so young as i once was and there is no sense denying it i was fifty nine my last birthday i dont feel it but there is no gainsaying the family bible     chapter xxvii a sacred concert   in spite of miss cornelias new point of view she could not help feeling a little disturbed over the next performance of the manse children in public she carried off the situation splendidly saying to all the gossips the substance of what anne had said in daffodil time and saying it so pointedly and forcibly that her hearers found themselves feeling rather foolish and began to think that after all they were making too much of a childish prank but in private miss cornelia allowed herself the relief of bemoaning it to anne  anne dearie they had a concert in the graveyard last thursday evening while the methodist prayer meeting was going on there they sat on hezekiah pollocks tombstone and sang for a solid hour of course i understand it was mostly hymns they sang and it wouldnt have been quite so bad if theyd done nothing else but im told they finished up with polly wolly doodle at full length and that just when deacon baxter was praying  i was there that night said susan and although i did not say anything about it to you mrs dr dear i could not help thinking that it was a great pity they picked that particular evening it was truly blood curdling to hear them sitting there in that abode of the dead shouting that frivolous song at the tops of their lungs  i dont know what you were doing in a methodist prayer meeting said miss cornelia acidly  i have never found that methodism was catching retorted susan stiffly and as i was going to say when i was interrupted badly as i felt i did not give in to the methodists when mrs deacon baxter said as we came out ‘what a disgraceful exhibition i said looking her fairly in the eye ‘they are all beautiful singers and none of your choir mrs baxter ever bother themselves coming out to your prayer meeting it seems their voices appear to be in tune only on sundays she was quite meek and i felt that i had snubbed her properly but i could have done it much more thoroughly mrs dr dear if only they had left out polly wolly doodle it is truly terrible to think of that being sung in a graveyard  some of those dead folks sang polly wolly doodle when they were living susan perhaps they like to hear it yet suggested gilbert  miss cornelia looked at him reproachfully and made up her mind that on some future occasion she would hint to anne that the doctor should be admonished not to say such things they might injure his practice people might get it into their heads that he wasnt orthodox to be sure marshall said even worse things habitually but then he was not a public man  i understand that their father was in his study all the time with his windows open but never noticed them at all of course he was lost in a book as usual but i spoke to him about it yesterday when he called  how could you dare mrs marshall elliott asked susan rebukingly  dare its time somebody dared something why they say he knows nothing about that letter of faiths to the journal because nobody liked to mention it to him he never looks at a journal of course but i thought he ought to know of this to prevent any such performances in future he said he would ‘discuss it with them but of course hed never think of it again after he got out of our gate that man has no sense of humour anne believe me he preached last sunday on ‘how to bring up children a beautiful sermon it was too and everybody in church thinking ‘what a pity you cant practise what you preach  miss cornelia did mr meredith an injustice in thinking he would soon forget what she had told him he went home much disturbed and when the children came from rainbow valley that night at a much later hour than they should have been prowling in it he called them into his study  they went in somewhat awed it was such an unusual thing for their father to do what could he be going to say to them they racked their memories for any recent transgression of sufficient importance but could not recall any carl had spilled a saucerful of jam on mrs peter flaggs silk dress two evenings before when at aunt marthas invitation she had stayed to supper but mr meredith had not noticed it and mrs flagg who was a kindly soul had made no fuss besides carl had been punished by having to wear unas dress all the rest of the evening  una suddenly thought that perhaps her father meant to tell them that he was going to marry miss west her heart began to beat violently and her legs trembled then she saw that mr meredith looked very stern and sorrowful no it could not be that  children said mr meredith i have heard something that has pained me very much is it true that you sat out in the graveyard all last thursday evening and sang ribald songs while a prayer meeting was being held in the methodist church  great caesar dad we forgot all about it being their prayer meeting night exclaimed jerry in dismay  then it is true you did do this thing  why dad i dont know what you mean by ribald songs we sang hymns it was a sacred concert you know what harm was that i tell you we never thought about its being methodist prayer meeting night they used to have their meeting tuesday nights and since theyve changed to thursdays its hard to remember  did you sing nothing but hymns  why said jerry turning red we did sing polly wolly doodle at the last faith said ‘lets have something cheerful to wind up with but we didnt mean any harm father truly we didnt  the concert was my idea father said faith afraid that mr meredith might blame jerry too much you know the methodists themselves had a sacred concert in their church three sunday nights ago i thought it would be good fun to get one up in imitation of it only they had prayers at theirs and we left that part out because we heard that people thought it awful for us to pray in a graveyard you were sitting in here all the time she added and never said a word to us  i did not notice what you were doing that is no excuse for me of course i am more to blame than you i realize that but why did you sing that foolish song at the end  we didnt think muttered jerry feeling that it was a very lame excuse seeing that he had lectured faith so strongly in the good conduct club sessions for her lack of thought were sorry father truly we are pitch into us hard we deserve a regular combing down  but mr meredith did no combing down or pitching into he sat down and gathered his small culprits close to him and talked a little to them tenderly and wisely they were overcome with remorse and shame and felt that they could never be so silly and thoughtless again  weve just got to punish ourselves good and hard for this whispered jerry as they crept upstairs well have a session of the club first thing tomorrow and decide how well do it i never saw father so cut up but i wish to goodness the methodists would stick to one night for their prayer meeting and not wander all over the week  anyhow im glad it wasnt what i was afraid it was murmured una to herself  behind them in the study mr meredith had sat down at his desk and buried his face in his arms  god help me he said im a poor sort of father oh rosemary if you had only cared     chapter xxviii a fast day   the good conduct club had a special session the next morning before school after various suggestions it was decided that a fast day would be an appropriate punishment  we wont eat a single thing for a whole day said jerry im kind of curious to see what fasting is like anyhow this will be a good chance to find out  what day will we choose for it asked una who thought it would be quite an easy punishment and rather wondered that jerry and faith had not devised something harder  lets pick monday said faith we mostly have a pretty filling dinner on sundays and mondays meals never amount to much anyhow  but thats just the point exclaimed jerry we mustnt take the easiest day to fast but the hardest and thats sunday because as you say we mostly have roast beef that day instead of cold ditto it wouldnt be much punishment to fast from ditto lets take next sunday it will be a good day for father is going to exchange for the morning service with the upper lowbridge minister father will be away till evening if aunt martha wonders whats got into us well tell her right up that were fasting for the good of our souls and it is in the bible and she is not to interfere and i guess she wont  aunt martha did not she merely said in her fretful mumbling way what foolishness are you young rips up to now and thought no more about it mr meredith had gone away early in the morning before any one was up he went without his breakfast too but that was of course of common occurrence half of the time he forgot it and there was no one to remind him of it breakfast aunt marthas breakfast was not a hard meal to miss even the hungry young rips did not feel it any great deprivation to abstain from the lumpy porridge and blue milk which had aroused the scorn of mary vance but it was different at dinner time they were furiously hungry then and the odor of roast beef which pervaded the manse and which was wholly delightful in spite of the fact that the roast beef was badly underdone was almost more than they could stand in desperation they rushed to the graveyard where they couldnt smell it but una could not keep her eyes from the dining room window through which the upper lowbridge minister could be seen placidly eating  if i could only have just a weeny teeny piece she sighed  now you stop that commanded jerry of course its hard but thats the punishment of it i could eat a graven image this very minute but am i complaining lets think of something else weve just got to rise above our stomachs  at supper time they did not feel the pangs of hunger which they had suffered earlier in the day  i suppose were getting used to it said faith i feel an awfully queer all gone sort of feeling but i cant say im hungry  my head is funny said una it goes round and round sometimes  but she went gamely to church with the others if mr meredith had not been so wholly wrapped up in and carried away with his subject he might have noticed the pale little face and hollow eyes in the manse pew beneath but he noticed nothing and his sermon was something longer than usual then just before he gave out the final hymn una meredith tumbled off the seat of the manse pew and lay in a dead faint on the floor  mrs elder clow was the first to reach her she caught the thin little body from the arms of white faced terrified faith and carried it into the vestry mr meredith forgot the hymn and everything else and rushed madly after her the congregation dismissed itself as best it could  oh mrs clow gasped faith is una dead have we killed her  what is the matter with my child demanded the pale father  she has just fainted i think said mrs clow oh heres the doctor thank goodness  gilbert did not find it a very easy thing to bring una back to consciousness he worked over her for a long time before her eyes opened then he carried her over to the manse followed by faith sobbing hysterically in her relief  she is just hungry you know she didnt eat a thing to day none of us did we were all fasting  fasting said mr meredith and fasting said the doctor  yes to punish ourselves for singing polly wolly in the graveyard said faith  my child i dont want you to punish yourselves for that said mr meredith in distress i gave you your little scolding and you were all penitent and i forgave you  yes but we had to be punished explained faith its our rule in our good conduct club you know if we do anything wrong or anything that is likely to hurt father in the congregation we have to punish ourselves we are bringing ourselves up you know because there is nobody to do it  mr meredith groaned but the doctor got up from unas side with an air of relief  then this child simply fainted from lack of food and all she needs is a good square meal he said mrs clow will you be kind enough to see she gets it and i think from faiths story that they all would be the better for something to eat or we shall have more faintings  i suppose we shouldnt have made una fast said faith remorsefully when i think of it only jerry and i should have been punished we got up the concert and we were the oldest  i sang polly wolly just the same as the rest of you said unas weak little voice so i had to be punished too  mrs clow came with a glass of milk faith and jerry and carl sneaked off to the pantry and john meredith went into his study where he sat in the darkness for a long time alone with his bitter thoughts so his children were bringing themselves up because there was nobody to do it struggling along amid their little perplexities without a hand to guide or a voice to counsel faiths innocently uttered phrase rankled in her fathers mind like a barbed shaft there was nobody to look after them to comfort their little souls and care for their little bodies how frail una had looked lying there on the vestry sofa in that long faint how thin were her tiny hands how pallid her little face she looked as if she might slip away from him in a breath sweet little una of whom cecilia had begged him to take such special care since his wifes death he had not felt such an agony of dread as when he had hung over his little girl in her unconsciousness he must do something but what should he ask elizabeth kirk to marry him she was a good woman she would be kind to his children he might bring himself to do it if it were not for his love for rosemary west but until he had crushed that out he could not seek another woman in marriage and he could not crush it out he had tried and he could not rosemary had been in church that evening for the first time since her return from kingsport he had caught a glimpse of her face in the back of the crowded church just as he had finished his sermon his heart had given a fierce throb he sat while the choir sang the collection piece with his bent head and tingling pulses he had not seen her since the evening upon which he had asked her to marry him when he had risen to give out the hymn his hands were trembling and his pale face was flushed then unas fainting spell had banished everything from his mind for a time now in the darkness and solitude of the study it rushed back rosemary was the only woman in the world for him it was of no use for him to think of marrying any other he could not commit such a sacrilege even for his childrens sake he must take up his burden alone he must try to be a better a more watchful father he must tell his children not to be afraid to come to him with all their little problems then he lighted his lamp and took up a bulky new book which was setting the theological world by the ears he would read just one chapter to compose his mind five minutes later he was lost to the world and the troubles of the world     chapter xxix a weird tale   on an early june evening rainbow valley was an entirely delightful place and the children felt it to be so as they sat in the open glade where the bells rang elfishly on the tree lovers and the white lady shook her green tresses the wind was laughing and whistling about them like a leal glad hearted comrade the young ferns were spicy in the hollow the wild cherry trees scattered over the valley among the dark firs were mistily white the robins were whistling over in the maples behind ingleside beyond on the slopes of the glen were blossoming orchards sweet and mystic and wonderful veiled in dusk it was spring and young things must be glad in spring everybody was glad in rainbow valley that evening until mary vance froze their blood with the story of henry warrens ghost  jem was not there jem spent his evenings now studying for his entrance examination in the ingleside garret jerry was down near the pond trouting walter had been reading longfellows sea poems to the others and they were steeped in the beauty and mystery of the ships then they talked of what they would do when they were grown up where they would travel the far fair shores they would see nan and di meant to go to europe walter longed for the nile moaning past its egyptian sands and a glimpse of the sphinx faith opined rather dismally that she supposed she would have to be a missionary old mrs taylor told her she ought to be and then she would at least see india or china those mysterious lands of the orient carls heart was set on african jungles una said nothing she thought she would just like to stay at home it was prettier here than anywhere else it would be dreadful when they were all grown up and had to scatter over the world the very idea made una feel lonesome and homesick but the others dreamed on delightedly until mary vance arrived and vanished poesy and dreams at one fell swoop  laws but im out of puff she exclaimed ive run down that hill like sixty i got an awful scare up there at the old bailey place  what frightened you asked di  i dunno i was poking about under them lilacs in the old garden trying to see if there was any lilies of the valley out yet it was dark as a pocket there and all at once i seen something stirring and rustling round at the other side of the garden in those cherry bushes it was white i tell you i didnt stop for a second look i flew over the dyke quicker than quick i was sure it was henry warrens ghost  who was henry warren asked di  and why should he have a ghost asked nan  laws did you never hear the story and you brought up in the glen well wait a minute till i get by breath all back and ill tell you  walter shivered delightsomely he loved ghost stories their mystery their dramatic climaxes their eeriness gave him a fearful exquisite pleasure longfellow instantly grew tame and commonplace he threw the book aside and stretched himself out propped upon his elbows to listen whole heartedly fixing his great luminous eyes on marys face mary wished he wouldnt look at her so she felt she could make a better job of the ghost story if walter were not looking at her she could put on several frills and invent a few artistic details to enhance the horror as it was she had to stick to the bare truth or what had been told her for the truth  well she began you know old tom bailey and his wife used to live in that house up there thirty years ago he was an awful old rip they say and his wife wasnt much better theyd no children of their own but a sister of old toms died and left a little boy this henry warren and they took him he was about twelve when he came to them and kind of undersized and delicate they say tom and his wife used him awful from the start whipped him and starved him folks said they wanted him to die sos they could get the little bit of money his mother had left for him henry didnt die right off but he begun having fits epileps they called ‘em and he grew up kind of simple till he was about eighteen his uncle used to thrash him in that garden up there ‘cause it was back of the house where no one could see him but folks could hear and they say it was awful sometimes hearing poor henry plead with his uncle not to kill him but nobody dared interfere ‘cause old tom was such a reprobate hed have been sure to get square with ‘em some way he burned the barns of a man at harbour head who offended him at last henry died and his uncle and aunt give out he died in one of his fits and that was all anybody ever knowed but everybody said tom had just up and killed him for keeps at last and it wasnt long till it got around that henry walked that old garden was hanted he was heard there at nights moaning and crying old tom and his wife got out went out west and never came back the place got such a bad name nobodyd buy or rent it thats why its all gone to ruin that was thirty years ago but henry warrens ghost hants it yet  do you believe that asked nan scornfully i dont  well good people have seen him and heard him retorted mary they say he appears and grovels on the ground and holds you by the legs and gibbers and moans like he did when he was alive i thought of that as soon as i seen that white thing in the bushes and thought if it caught me like that and moaned id drop down dead on the spot so i cut and run it mightnt have been his ghost but i wasnt going to take any chances with a hant  it was likely old mrs stimsons white calf laughed di it pastures in that garden ive seen it  maybe so but im not going home through the bailey garden any more heres jerry with a big string of trout and its my turn to cook them jem and jerry both say im the best cook in the glen and cornelia told me i could bring up this batch of cookies i all but dropped them when i saw henrys ghost  jerry hooted when he heard the ghost story which mary repeated as she fried the fish touching it up a trifle or so since walter had gone to help faith to set the table it made no impression on jerry but faith and una and carl had been secretly much frightened though they would never have given in to it it was all right as long as the others were with them in the valley  but when the feast was over and the shadows fell they quaked with remembrance jerry went up to ingleside with the blythes to see jem about something and mary vance went around that way home so faith and una and carl had to go back to the manse alone they walked very close together and gave the old bailey garden a wide berth they did not believe that it was haunted of course but they would not go near it for all that     chapter xxx the ghost on the dyke   somehow faith and carl and una could not shake off the hold which the story of henry warrens ghost had taken upon their imaginations they had never believed in ghosts ghost tales they had heard a plenty mary vance had told some far more blood curdling than this but those tales were all of places and people and spooks far away and unknown after the first half awful half pleasant thrill of awe and terror they thought of them no more but this story came home to them the old bailey garden was almost at their very door almost in their beloved rainbow valley they had passed and repassed it constantly they had hunted for flowers in it they had made short cuts through it when they wished to go straight from the village to the valley but never again after the night when mary vance told them its gruesome tale they would not have gone through or near it on pain of death death what was death compared to the unearthly possibility of falling into the clutches of henry warrens grovelling ghost  one warm july evening the three of them were sitting under the tree lovers feeling a little lonely nobody else had come near the valley that evening jem blythe was away in charlottetown writing on his entrance examinations jerry and walter blythe were off for a sail on the harbour with old captain crawford nan and di and rilla and shirley had gone down the harbour road to visit kenneth and persis ford who had come with their parents for a flying visit to the little old house of dreams nan had asked faith to go with them but faith had declined she would never have admitted it but she felt a little secret jealousy of persis ford concerning whose wonderful beauty and city glamour she had heard a great deal no she wasnt going to go down there and play second fiddle to anybody she and una took their story books to rainbow valley and read while carl investigated bugs along the banks of the brook and all three were happy until they suddenly realized that it was twilight and that the old bailey garden was uncomfortably near by carl came and sat down close to the girls they all wished they had gone home a little sooner but nobody said anything  great velvety purple clouds heaped up in the west and spread over the valley there was no wind and everything was suddenly strangely dreadfully still the marsh was full of thousands of fire flies surely some fairy parliament was being convened that night altogether rainbow valley was not a canny place just then  faith looked fearfully up the valley to the old bailey garden then if anybodys blood ever did freeze faith merediths certainly froze at that moment the eyes of carl and una followed her entranced gaze and chills began gallopading up and down their spines also for there under the big tamarack tree on the tumble down grass grown dyke of the bailey garden was something white shapelessly white in the gathering gloom the three merediths sat and gazed as if turned to stone  its its the calf whispered una at last  its too big for the calf whispered faith her mouth and lips were so dry she could hardly articulate the words  suddenly carl gasped  its coming here  the girls gave one last agonized glance yes it was creeping down over the dyke as no calf ever did or could creep reason fled before sudden over mastering panic for the moment every one of the trio was firmly convinced that what they saw was henry warrens ghost carl sprang to his feet and bolted blindly with a simultaneous shriek the girls followed him like mad creatures they tore up the hill across the road and into the manse they had left aunt martha sewing in the kitchen she was not there they rushed to the study it was dark and tenantless as with one impulse they swung around and made for ingleside but not across rainbow valley down the hill and through the glen street they flew on the wings of their wild terror carl in the lead una bringing up the rear nobody tried to stop them though everybody who saw them wondered what fresh devilment those manse youngsters were up to now but at the gate of ingleside they ran into rosemary west who had just been in for a moment to return some borrowed books  she saw their ghastly faces and staring eyes she realized that their poor little souls were wrung with some awful and real fear whatever its cause she caught carl with one arm and faith with the other una stumbled against her and held on desperately  children dear what has happened she said what has frightened you  henry warrens ghost answered carl through his chattering teeth  henry warrens ghost said amazed rosemary who had never heard the story  yes sobbed faith hysterically its there on the bailey dyke we saw it and it started to chase us  rosemary herded the three distracted creatures to the ingleside veranda gilbert and anne were both away having also gone to the house of dreams but susan appeared in the doorway gaunt and practical and unghostlike  what is all this rumpus about she inquired  again the children gasped out their awful tale while rosemary held them close to her and soothed them with wordless comfort  likely it was an owl said susan unstirred  an owl the meredith children never had any opinion of susans intelligence after that  it was bigger than a million owls said carl sobbing oh how ashamed carl was of that sobbing in after days and it it grovelled just as mary said and it was crawling down over the dyke to get at us do owls crawl  rosemary looked at susan  they must have seen something to frighten them so she said  i will go and see said susan coolly now children calm yourselves whatever you have seen it was not a ghost as for poor henry warren i feel sure he would be only too glad to rest quietly in his peaceful grave once he got there no fear of him venturing back and that you may tie to if you can make them see reason miss west i will find out the truth of the matter  susan departed for rainbow valley valiantly grasping a pitchfork which she found leaning against the back fence where the doctor had been working in his little hay field a pitchfork might not be of much use against hants but it was a comforting sort of weapon there was nothing to be seen in rainbow valley when susan reached it no white visitants appeared to be lurking in the shadowy tangled old bailey garden susan marched boldly through it and beyond it and rapped with her pitchfork on the door of the little cottage on the other side where mrs stimson lived with her two daughters  back at ingleside rosemary had succeeded in calming the children they still sobbed a little from shock but they were beginning to feel a lurking and salutary suspicion that they had made dreadful geese of themselves this suspicion became a certainty when susan finally returned  i have found out what your ghost was she said with a grim smile sitting down on a rocker and fanning herself old mrs stimson has had a pair of factory cotton sheets bleaching in the bailey garden for a week she spread them on the dyke under the tamarack tree because the grass was clean and short there this evening she went out to take them in she had her knitting in her hands so she hung the sheets over her shoulders by way of carrying them and then she must have dropped one of her needles and find it she could not and has not yet but she went down on her knees and crept about to hunt for it and she was at that when she heard awful yells down in the valley and saw the three children tearing up the hill past her she thought they had been bit by something and it gave her poor old heart such a turn that she could not move or speak but just crouched there till they disappeared then she staggered back home and they have been applying stimulants to her ever since and her heart is in a terrible condition and she says she will not get over this fright all summer  the merediths sat crimson with a shame that even rosemarys understanding sympathy could not remove they sneaked off home met jerry at the manse gate and made remorseful confession a session of the good conduct club was arranged for next morning  wasnt miss west sweet to us to night whispered faith in bed  yes admitted una it is such a pity it changes people so much to be made stepmothers  i dont believe it does said faith loyally     chapter xxxi carl does penance   i dont see why we should be punished at all said faith rather sulkily we didnt do anything wrong we couldnt help being frightened and it wont do father any harm it was just an accident  you were cowards said jerry with judicial scorn and you gave way to your cowardice that is why you should be punished everybody will laugh at you about this and that is a disgrace to the family  if you knew how awful the whole thing was said faith with a shiver you would think we had been punished enough already i wouldnt go through it again for anything in the whole world  i believe youd have run yourself if youd been there muttered carl  from an old woman in a cotton sheet mocked jerry ho ho ho  it didnt look a bit like an old woman cried faith it was just a great big white thing crawling about in the grass just as mary vance said henry warren did its all very fine for you to laugh jerry meredith but youd have laughed on the other side of your mouth if youd been there and how are we to be punished i dont think its fair but lets know what we have to do judge meredith  the way i look at it said jerry frowning is that carl was the most to blame he bolted first as i understand it besides he was a boy so he should have stood his ground to protect you girls whatever the danger was you know that carl dont you  i spose so growled carl shamefacedly  very well this is to be your punishment to night youll sit on mr hezekiah pollocks tombstone in the graveyard alone until twelve oclock  carl gave a little shudder the graveyard was not so very far from the old bailey garden it would be a trying ordeal but carl was anxious to wipe out his disgrace and prove that he was not a coward after all  all right he said sturdily but howll i know when it is twelve  the study windows are open and youll hear the clock striking and mind you that you are not to budge out of that graveyard until the last stroke as for you girls youve got to go without jam at supper for a week  faith and una looked rather blank they were inclined to think that even carls comparatively short though sharp agony was lighter punishment than this long drawn out ordeal a whole week of soggy bread without the saving grace of jam but no shirking was permitted in the club the girls accepted their lot with such philosophy as they could summon up  that night they all went to bed at nine except carl who was already keeping vigil on the tombstone una slipped in to bid him good night her tender heart was wrung with sympathy  oh carl are you much scared she whispered  not a bit said carl airily  i wont sleep a wink till after twelve said una if you get lonesome just look up at our window and remember that im inside awake and thinking about you that will be a little company wont it  ill be all right dont you worry about me said carl  but in spite of his dauntless words carl was a pretty lonely boy when the lights went out in the manse he had hoped his father would be in the study as he so often was he would not feel alone then but that night mr meredith had been summoned to the fishing village at the harbour mouth to see a dying man he would not likely be back until after midnight carl must dree his weird alone  a glen man went past carrying a lantern the mysterious shadows caused by the lantern light went hurtling madly over the graveyard like a dance of demons or witches then they passed and darkness fell again one by one the lights in the glen went out it was a very dark night with a cloudy sky and a raw east wind that was cold in spite of the calendar far away on the horizon was the low dim lustre of the charlottetown lights the wind wailed and sighed in the old fir trees mr alec davis tall monument gleamed whitely through the gloom the willow beside it tossed long writhing arms spectrally at times the gyrations of its boughs made it seem as if the monument were moving too  carl curled himself up on the tombstone with his legs tucked under him it wasnt precisely pleasant to hang them over the edge of the stone just suppose just suppose bony hands should reach up out of mr pollocks grave under it and clutch him by the ankles that had been one of mary vances cheerful speculations one time when they had all been sitting there it returned to haunt carl now he didnt believe those things he didnt even really believe in henry warrens ghost as for mr pollock he had been dead sixty years so it wasnt likely he cared who sat on his tombstone now but there is something very strange and terrible in being awake when all the rest of the world is asleep you are alone then with nothing but your own feeble personality to pit against the mighty principalities and powers of darkness carl was only ten and the dead were all around him and he wished oh he wished that the clock would strike twelve would it never strike twelve surely aunt martha must have forgotten to wind it  and then it struck eleven only eleven he must stay yet another hour in that grim place if only there were a few friendly stars to be seen the darkness was so thick it seemed to press against his face there was a sound as of stealthy passing footsteps all over the graveyard carl shivered partly with prickling terror partly with real cold  then it began to rain a chill penetrating drizzle carls thin little cotton blouse and shirt were soon wet through he felt chilled to the bone he forgot mental terrors in his physical discomfort but he must stay there till twelve he was punishing himself and he was on his honour nothing had been said about rain but it did not make any difference when the study clock finally struck twelve a drenched little figure crept stiffly down off mr pollocks tombstone made its way into the manse and upstairs to bed carls teeth were chattering he thought he would never get warm again  he was warm enough when morning came jerry gave one startled look at his crimson face and then rushed to call his father mr meredith came hurriedly his own face ivory white from the pallor of his long night vigil by a death bed he had not got home until daylight he bent over his little lad anxiously  carl are you sick he said  that tombstone over here said carl its moving about its coming at me keep it away please  mr meredith rushed to the telephone in ten minutes dr blythe was at the manse half an hour later a wire was sent to town for a trained nurse and all the glen knew that carl meredith was very ill with pneumonia and that dr blythe had been seen to shake his head  gilbert shook his head more than once in the fortnight that followed carl developed double pneumonia there was one night when mr meredith paced his study floor and faith and una huddled in their bedroom and cried and jerry wild with remorse refused to budge from the floor of the hall outside carls door dr blythe and the nurse never left the bedside they fought death gallantly until the red dawn and they won the victory carl rallied and passed the crisis in safety the news was phoned about the waiting glen and people found out how much they really loved their minister and his children  i havent had one decent nights sleep since i heard the child was sick miss cornelia told anne and mary vance has cried until those queer eyes of hers looked like burnt holes in a blanket is it true that carl got pneumonia from straying out in the graveyard that wet night for a dare  no he was staying there to punish himself for cowardice in that affair of the warren ghost it seems they have a club for bringing themselves up and they punish themselves when they do wrong jerry told mr meredith all about it  the poor little souls said miss cornelia  carl got better rapidly for the congregation took enough nourishing things to the manse to furnish forth a hospital norman douglas drove up every evening with a dozen fresh eggs and a jar of jersey cream sometimes he stayed an hour and bellowed arguments on predestination with mr meredith in the study oftener he drove on up to the hill that overlooked the glen  when carl was able to go again to rainbow valley they had a special feast in his honour and the doctor came down and helped them with the fireworks mary vance was there too but she did not tell any ghost stories miss cornelia had given her a talking on that subject which mary would not forget in a hurry     chapter xxxii two stubborn people   rosemary west on her way home from a music lesson at ingleside turned aside to the hidden spring in rainbow valley she had not been there all summer the beautiful little spot had no longer any allurement for her the spirit of her young lover never came to the tryst now and the memories connected with john meredith were too painful and poignant but she had happened to glance backward up the valley and had seen norman douglas vaulting as airily as a stripling over the old stone dyke of the bailey garden and thought he was on his way up the hill if he overtook her she would have to walk home with him and she was not going to do that so she slipped at once behind the maples of the spring hoping he had not seen her and would pass on  but norman had seen her and what was more was in pursuit of her he had been wanting for some time to have talk with rosemary but she had always so it seemed avoided him rosemary had never at any time liked norman douglas very well his bluster his temper his noisy hilarity had always antagonized her long ago she had often wondered how ellen could possibly be attracted to him norman douglas was perfectly aware of her dislike and he chuckled over it it never worried norman if people did not like him it did not even make him dislike them in return for he took it as a kind of extorted compliment he thought rosemary a fine girl and he meant to be an excellent generous brother in law to her but before he could be her brother in law he had to have a talk with her so having seen her leaving ingleside as he stood in the doorway of a glen store he had straightway plunged into the valley to overtake her  rosemary was sitting pensively on the maple seat where john meredith had been sitting on that evening nearly a year ago the tiny spring shimmered and dimpled under its fringe of ferns ruby red gleams of sunset fell through the arching boughs a tall clump of perfect asters grew at her side the little spot was as dreamy and witching and evasive as any retreat of fairies and dryads in ancient forests into it norman douglas bounced scattering and annihilating its charm in a moment his personality seemed to swallow the place up there was simply nothing there but norman douglas big red bearded complacent  good evening said rosemary coldly standing up  ‘evening girl sit down again sit down again i want to have a talk with you bless the girl whats she looking at me like that for i dont want to eat you ive had my supper sit down and be civil  i can hear what you have to say quite as well here said rosemary  so you can girl if you use your ears i only wanted you to be comfortable you look so durned uncomfortable standing there well ill sit anyway  norman accordingly sat down in the very place john meredith had once sat the contrast was so ludicrous that rosemary was afraid she would go off into a peal of hysterical laughter over it norman cast his hat aside placed his huge red hands on his knees and looked up at her with his eyes a twinkle  come girl dont be so stiff he said ingratiatingly when he liked he could be very ingratiating lets have a reasonable sensible friendly chat theres something i want to ask you ellen says she wont so its up to me to do it  rosemary looked down at the spring which seemed to have shrunk to the size of a dewdrop norman gazed at her in despair  durn it all you might help a fellow out a bit he burst forth  what is it you want me to help you say asked rosemary scornfully  you know as well as i do girl dont be putting on your tragedy airs no wonder ellen was scared to ask you look here girl ellen and i want to marry each other thats plain english isnt it got that and ellen says she cant unless you give her back some tom fool promise she made come now will you do it will you do it  yes said rosemary  norman bounced up and seized her reluctant hand  good i knew you would i told ellen you would i knew it would only take a minute now girl you go home and tell ellen and well have a wedding in a fortnight and youll come and live with us we shant leave you to roost on that hill top like a lonely crow dont you worry i know you hate me but lord itll be great fun living with some one that hates me lifell have some spice in it after this ellen will roast me and youll freeze me i wont have a dull moment  rosemary did not condescend to tell him that nothing would ever induce her to live in his house she let him go striding back to the glen oozing delight and complacency and she walked slowly up the hill home she had known this was coming ever since she had returned from kingsport and found norman douglas established as a frequent evening caller his name was never mentioned between her and ellen but the very avoidance of it was significant it was not in rosemarys nature to feel bitter or she would have felt very bitter she was coldly civil to norman and she made no difference in any way with ellen but ellen had not found much comfort in her second courtship  she was in the garden attended by st george when rosemary came home the two sisters met in the dahlia walk st george sat down on the gravel walk between them and folded his glossy black tail gracefully around his white paws with all the indifference of a well fed well bred well groomed cat  did you ever see such dahlias demanded ellen proudly they are just the finest weve ever had  rosemary had never cared for dahlias their presence in the garden was her concession to ellens taste she noticed one huge mottled one of crimson and yellow that lorded it over all the others  that dahlia she said pointing to it is exactly like norman douglas it might easily be his twin brother  ellens dark browed face flushed she admired the dahlia in question but she knew rosemary did not and that no compliment was intended but she dared not resent rosemarys speech poor ellen dared not resent anything just then and it was the first time rosemary had ever mentioned normans name to her she felt that this portended something  i met norman douglas in the valley said rosemary looking straight at her sister and he told me you and he wanted to be married if i would give you permission  yes what did you say asked ellen trying to speak naturally and off handedly and failing completely she could not meet rosemarys eyes she looked down at st georges sleek back and felt horribly afraid rosemary had either said she would or she wouldnt if she would ellen would feel so ashamed and remorseful that she would be a very uncomfortable bride elect and if she wouldnt well ellen had once learned to live without norman douglas but she had forgotten the lesson and felt that she could never learn it again  i said that as far as i was concerned you were at full liberty to marry each other as soon as you liked said rosemary  thank you said ellen still looking at st george  rosemarys face softened  i hope youll be happy ellen she said gently  oh rosemary ellen looked up in distress im so ashamed i dont deserve it after all i said to you   we wont speak about that said rosemary hurriedly and decidedly  but but persisted ellen you are free now too and its not too late john meredith   ellen west rosemary had a little spark of temper under all her sweetness and it flashed forth now in her blue eyes have you quite lost your senses in every respect do you suppose for an instant that i am going to go to john meredith and say meekly ‘please sir ive changed my mind and please sir i hope you havent changed yours is that what you want me to do  no no but a little encouragement he would come back   never he despises me and rightly no more of this ellen i bear you no grudge marry whom you like but no meddling in my affairs  then you must come and live with me said ellen i shall not leave you here alone  do you really think that i would go and live in norman douglass house  why not cried ellen half angrily despite her humiliation  rosemary began to laugh  ellen i thought you had a sense of humour can you see me doing it  i dont see why you wouldnt his house is big enough youd have your share of it to yourself he wouldnt interfere  ellen the thing is not to be thought of dont bring this up again  then said ellen coldly and determinedly i shall not marry him i shall not leave you here alone that is all there is to be said about it  nonsense ellen  it is not nonsense it is my firm decision it would be absurd for you to think of living here by yourself a mile from any other house if you wont come with me ill stay with you now we wont argue the matter so dont try  i shall leave norman to do the arguing said rosemary  ill deal with norman i can manage him i would never have asked you to give me back my promise never but i had to tell norman why i couldnt marry him and he said he would ask you i couldnt prevent him you need not suppose you are the only person in the world who possesses self respect i never dreamed of marrying and leaving you here alone and youll find i can be as determined as yourself  rosemary turned away and went into the house with a shrug of her shoulders ellen looked down at st george who had never blinked an eyelash or stirred a whisker during the whole interview  st george this world would be a dull place without the men ill admit but im almost tempted to wish there wasnt one of ‘em in it look at the trouble and bother theyve made right here george torn our happy old life completely up by the roots saint john meredith began it and norman douglas has finished it and now both of them have to go into limbo norman is the only man i ever met who agrees with me that the kaiser of germany is the most dangerous creature alive on this earth and i cant marry this sensible person because my sister is stubborn and im stubborner mark my words st george the minister would come back if she raised her little finger but she wont george shell never do it she wont even crook it and i dont dare meddle saint i wont sulk george rosemary didnt sulk so im determined i wont either saint norman will tear up the turf but the long and short of it is st george that all of us old fools must just stop thinking of marrying well well ‘despair is a free man hope is a slave saint so now come into the house george and ill solace you with a saucerful of cream then there will be one happy and contented creature on this hill at least     chapter xxxiii carl is not whipped   there is something i think i ought to tell you said mary vance mysteriously  she and faith and una were walking arm in arm through the village having foregathered at mr flaggs store una and faith exchanged looks which said now something disagreeable is coming when mary vance thought she ought to tell them things there was seldom much pleasure in the hearing they often wondered why they kept on liking mary vance for like her they did in spite of everything to be sure she was generally a stimulating and agreeable companion if only she would not have those convictions that it was her duty to tell them things  do you know that rosemary west wont marry your pa because she thinks you are such a wild lot shes afraid she couldnt bring you up right and so she turned him down  unas heart thrilled with secret exultation she was very glad to hear that miss west would not marry her father but faith was rather disappointed  how do you know she asked  oh everybodys saying it i heard mrs elliott talking it over with mrs doctor they thought i was too far away to hear but ive got ears like a cats mrs elliott said she hadnt a doubt that rosemary was afraid to try stepmothering you because youd got such a reputation your pa never goes up the hill now neither does norman douglas folks say ellen has jilted him just to get square with him for jilting her ages ago but norman is going about declaring hell get her yet and i think you ought to know youve spoiled your pas match and i think its a pity for hes bound to marry somebody before long and rosemary west would have been the best wife i know of for him  you told me all stepmothers were cruel and wicked said una  oh well said mary rather confusedly theyre mostly awful cranky i know but rosemary west couldnt be very mean to any one i tell you if your pa turns round and marries emmeline drew youll wish youd behaved yourselves better and not frightened rosemary out of it its awful that youve got such a reputation that no decent womanll marry your pa on account of you of course i know that half the yarns that are told about you aint true but give a dog a bad name why some folks are saying that it was jerry and carl that threw the stones through mrs stimsons window the other night when it was really them two boyd boys but im afraid it was carl that put the eel in old mrs carrs buggy though i said at first i wouldnt believe it until id better proof than old kitty alecs word i told mrs elliott so right to her face  what did carl do cried faith  well they say now mind im only telling you what people say so theres no use in your blaming me for it that carl and a lot of other boys were fishing eels over the bridge one evening last week mrs carr drove past in that old rattletrap buggy of hers with the open back and carl he just up and threw a big eel into the back when poor old mrs carr was driving up the hill by ingleside that eel came squirming out between her feet she thought it was a snake and she just give one awful screech and stood up and jumped clean over the wheels the horse bolted but it went home and no damage was done but mrs carr jarred her legs most terrible and has had nervous spasms ever since whenever she thinks of the eel say it was a rotten trick to play on the poor old soul shes a decent body if she is as queer as dicks hat band  faith and una looked at each other again this was a matter for the good conduct club they would not talk it over with mary  there goes your pa said mary as mr meredith passed them and never seeing us no moren if we werent here well im getting sos i dont mind it but there are folks who do  mr meredith had not seen them but he was not walking along in his usual dreamy and abstracted fashion he strode up the hill in agitation and distress mrs alec davis had just told him the story of carl and the eel she had been very indignant about it old mrs carr was her third cousin mr meredith was more than indignant he was hurt and shocked he had not thought carl would do anything like this he was not inclined to be hard on pranks of heedlessness or forgetfulness but this was different this had a nasty tang in it when he reached home he found carl on the lawn patiently studying the habits and customs of a colony of wasps calling him into the study mr meredith confronted him with a sterner face than any of his children had ever seen before and asked him if the story were true  yes said carl flushing but meeting his fathers eyes bravely  mr meredith groaned he had hoped that there had been at least exaggeration  tell me the whole matter he said  the boys were fishing for eels over the bridge said carl link drew had caught a whopper i mean an awful big one the biggest eel i ever saw he caught it right at the start and it had been lying in his basket a long time still as still i thought it was dead honest i did then old mrs carr drove over the bridge and she called us all young varmints and told us to go home and we hadnt said a word to her father truly so when she drove back again after going to the store the boys dared me to put links eel in her buggy i thought it was so dead it couldnt hurt her and i threw it in then the eel came to life on the hill and we heard her scream and saw her jump out i was awful sorry thats all father  it was not quite as bad as mr meredith had feared but it was quite bad enough i must punish you carl he said sorrowfully  yes i know father  i i must whip you  carl winced he had never been whipped then seeing how badly his father felt he said cheerfully  all right father  mr meredith misunderstood his cheerfulness and thought him insensible he told carl to come to the study after supper and when the boy had gone out he flung himself into his chair and groaned again he dreaded the evening sevenfold more than carl did the poor minister did not even know what he should whip his boy with what was used to whip boys rods canes no that would be too brutal a timber switch then and he john meredith must hie him to the woods and cut one it was an abominable thought then a picture presented itself unbidden to his mind he saw mrs carrs wizened nut cracker little face at the appearance of that reviving eel he saw her sailing witch like over the buggy wheels before he could prevent himself the minister laughed then he was angry with himself and angrier still with carl he would get that switch at once and it must not be too limber after all  carl was talking the matter over in the graveyard with faith and una who had just come home they were horrified at the idea of his being whipped and by father who had never done such a thing but they agreed soberly that it was just  you know it was a dreadful thing to do sighed faith and you never owned up in the club  i forgot said carl besides i didnt think any harm came of it i didnt know she jarred her legs but im to be whipped and that will make things square  will it hurt very much said una slipping her hand into carls  oh not so much i guess said carl gamely anyhow im not going to cry no matter how much it hurts it would make father feel so bad if i did hes all cut up now i wish i could whip myself hard enough and save him doing it  after supper at which carl had eaten little and mr meredith nothing at all both went silently into the study the switch lay on the table mr meredith had had a bad time getting a switch to suit him he cut one then felt it was too slender carl had done a really indefensible thing then he cut another it was far too thick after all carl had thought the eel was dead the third one suited him better but as he picked it up from the table it seemed very thick and heavy more like a stick than a switch  hold out your hand he said to carl  carl threw back his head and held out his hand unflinchingly but he was not very old and he could not quite keep a little fear out of his eyes mr meredith looked down into those eyes why they were cecilias eyes her very eyes and in them was the selfsame expression he had once seen in cecilias eyes when she had come to him to tell him something she had been a little afraid to tell him here were her eyes in carls little white face and six weeks ago he had thought through one endless terrible night that his little lad was dying  john meredith threw down the switch  go he said i cannot whip you  carl fled to the graveyard feeling that the look on his fathers face was worse than any whipping  is it over so soon asked faith she and una had been holding hands and setting teeth on the pollock tombstone  he he didnt whip me at all said carl with a sob and i wish he had and hes in there feeling just awful  una slipped away her heart yearned to comfort her father as noiselessly as a little gray mouse she opened the study door and crept in the room was dark with twilight her father was sitting at his desk his back was towards her his head was in his hands he was talking to himself broken anguished words but una heard heard and understood with the sudden illumination that comes to sensitive unmothered children as silently as she had come in she slipped out and closed the door john meredith went on talking out his pain in what he deemed his undisturbed solitude     chapter xxxiv una visits the hill   una went upstairs carl and faith were already on their way through the early moonlight to rainbow valley having heard therefrom the elfin lilt of jerrys jews harp and having guessed that the blythes were there and fun afoot una had no wish to go she sought her own room first where she sat down on her bed and had a little cry she did not want anybody to come in her dear mothers place she did not want a stepmother who would hate her and make her father hate her but father was so desperately unhappy and if she could do any anything to make him happier she must do it there was only one thing she could do and she had known the moment she had left the study that she must do it but it was a very hard thing to do  after una cried her heart out she wiped her eyes and went to the spare room it was dark and rather musty for the blind had not been drawn up nor the window opened for a long time aunt martha was no fresh air fiend but as nobody ever thought of shutting a door in the manse this did not matter so much save when some unfortunate minister came to stay all night and was compelled to breathe the spare room atmosphere  there was a closet in the spare room and far back in the closet a gray silk dress was hanging una went into the closet and shut the door went down on her knees and pressed her face against the soft silken folds it had been her mothers wedding dress it was still full of a sweet faint haunting perfume like lingering love una always felt very close to her mother there as if she were kneeling at her feet with head in her lap she went there once in a long while when life was too hard  mother she whispered to the gray silk gown i will never forget you mother and ill always love you best but i have to do it mother because father is so very unhappy i know you wouldnt want him to be unhappy and i will be very good to her mother and try to love her even if she is like mary vance said stepmothers always were  una carried some fine spiritual strength away from her secret shrine she slept peacefully that night with the tear stains still glistening on her sweet serious little face  the next afternoon she put on her best dress and hat they were shabby enough every other little girl in the glen had new clothes that summer except faith and una mary vance had a lovely dress of white embroidered lawn with scarlet silk sash and shoulder bows but to day una did not mind her shabbiness she only wanted to be very neat she washed her face carefully she brushed her black hair until it was as smooth as satin she tied her shoelaces carefully having first sewed up two runs in her one pair of good stockings she would have liked to black her shoes but she could not find any blacking finally she slipped away from the manse down through rainbow valley up through the whispering woods and out to the road that ran past the house on the hill it was quite a long walk and una was tired and warm when she got there  she saw rosemary west sitting under a tree in the garden and stole past the dahlia beds to her rosemary had a book in her lap but she was gazing afar across the harbour and her thoughts were sorrowful enough life had not been pleasant lately in the house on the hill ellen had not sulked ellen had been a brick but things can be felt that are never said and at times the silence between the two women was intolerably eloquent all the many familiar things that had once made life sweet had a flavour of bitterness now norman douglas made periodical irruptions also bullying and coaxing ellen by turns it would end rosemary believed by his dragging ellen off with him some day and rosemary felt that she would be almost glad when it happened existence would be horribly lonely then but it would be no longer charged with dynamite  she was roused from her unpleasant reverie by a timid little touch on her shoulder turning she saw una meredith  why una dear did you walk up here in all this heat  yes said una i came to i came to   but she found it very hard to say what she had come to do her voice failed her eyes filled with tears  why una little girl what is the trouble dont be afraid to tell me  rosemary put her arm around the thin little form and drew the child close to her her eyes were very beautiful her touch so tender that una found courage  i came to ask you to marry father she gasped  rosemary was silent for a moment from sheer dumbfounderment she stared at una blankly  oh dont be angry please dear miss west said una pleadingly you see everybody is saying that you wouldnt marry father because we are so bad he is very unhappy about it so i thought i would come and tell you that we are never bad on purpose and if you will only marry father we will all try to be good and do just what you tell us im sure you wont have any trouble with us please miss west  rosemary had been thinking rapidly gossiping surmise she saw had put this mistaken idea into unas mind she must be perfectly frank and sincere with the child  una dear she said softly it isnt because of you poor little souls that i cannot be your fathers wife i never thought of such a thing you are not bad i never supposed you were there there was another reason altogether una  dont you like father asked una lifting reproachful eyes oh miss west you dont know how nice he is im sure hed make you a good husband  even in the midst of her perplexity and distress rosemary couldnt help a twisted little smile  oh dont laugh miss west una cried passionately father feels dreadful about it  i think youre mistaken dear said rosemary  im not im sure im not oh miss west father was going to whip carl yesterday carl had been naughty and father couldnt do it because you see he had no practice in whipping so when carl came out and told us father felt so bad i slipped into the study to see if i could help him he likes me to comfort him miss west and he didnt hear me come in and i heard what he was saying ill tell you miss west if youll let me whisper it in your ear  una whispered earnestly rosemarys face turned crimson so john meredith still cared he hadnt changed his mind and he must care intensely if he had said that care more than she had ever supposed he did she sat still for a moment stroking unas hair then she said  will you take a little letter from me to your father una  oh are you going to marry him miss west asked una eagerly  perhaps if he really wants me to said rosemary blushing again  im glad im glad said una bravely then she looked up with quivering lips oh miss west you wont turn father against us you wont make him hate us will you she said beseechingly  rosemary stared again  una meredith do you think i would do such a thing whatever put such an idea into your head  mary vance said stepmothers were all like that and that they all hated their stepchildren and made their father hate them she said they just couldnt help it just being stepmothers made them like that   you poor child and yet you came up here and asked me to marry your father because you wanted to make him happy youre a darling a heroine as ellen would say youre a brick now listen to me very closely dearest mary vance is a silly little girl who doesnt know very much and she is dreadfully mistaken about some things i would never dream of trying to turn your father against you i would love you all dearly i dont want to take your own mothers place she must always have that in your hearts but neither have i any intention of being a stepmother i want to be your friend and helper and chum dont you think that would be nice una if you and faith and carl and jerry could just think of me as a good jolly chum a big older sister  oh it would be lovely cried una with a transfigured face she flung her arms impulsively round rosemarys neck she was so happy that she felt as if she could fly on wings  do the others do faith and the boys have the same idea you had about stepmothers  no faith never believed mary vance i was dreadfully foolish to believe her either faith loves you already she has loved you ever since poor adam was eaten and jerry and carl will think it is jolly oh miss west when you come to live with us will you could you teach me to cook a little and sew and and and do things i dont know anything i wont be much trouble ill try to learn fast  darling ill teach you and help you all i can now you wont say a word to anybody about this will you not even to faith until your father himself tells you you may and youll stay and have tea with me  oh thank you but but i think id rather go right back and take the letter to father faltered una you see hell be glad that much sooner miss west  i see said rosemary she went to the house wrote a note and gave it to una when that small damsel had run off a palpitating bundle of happiness rosemary went to ellen who was shelling peas on the back porch  ellen she said una meredith has just been here to ask me to marry her father  ellen looked up and read her sisters face  and youre going to she said  its quite likely  ellen went on shelling peas for a few minutes then she suddenly put her hands up to her own face there were tears in her black browed eyes  i i hope well all be happy she said between a sob and a laugh  down at the manse una meredith warm rosy triumphant marched boldly into her fathers study and laid a letter on the desk before him his pale face flushed as he saw the clear fine handwriting he knew so well he opened the letter it was very short but he shed twenty years as he read it rosemary asked him if he could meet her that evening at sunset by the spring in rainbow valley     chapter xxxv let the piper come   and so said miss cornelia the double wedding is to be sometime about the middle of this month  there was a faint chill in the air of the early september evening so anne had lighted her ever ready fire of driftwood in the big living room and she and miss cornelia basked in its fairy flicker  it is so delightful especially in regard to mr meredith and rosemary said anne im as happy in the thought of it as i was when i was getting married myself i felt exactly like a bride again last evening when i was up on the hill seeing rosemarys trousseau  they tell me her things are fine enough for a princess said susan from a shadowy corner where she was cuddling her brown boy i have been invited up to see them also and i intend to go some evening i understand that rosemary is to wear white silk and a veil but ellen is to be married in navy blue i have no doubt mrs dr dear that that is very sensible of her but for my own part i have always felt that if i were ever married i would prefer the white and the veil as being more bride like  a vision of susan in white and a veil presented itself before annes inner vision and was almost too much for her  as for mr meredith said miss cornelia even his engagement has made a different man of him he isnt half so dreamy and absent minded believe me i was so relieved when i heard that he had decided to close the manse and let the children visit round while he was away on his honeymoon if he had left them and old aunt martha there alone for a month i should have expected to wake every morning and see the place burned down  aunt martha and jerry are coming here said anne carl is going to elder clows i havent heard where the girls are going  oh im going to take them said miss cornelia of course i was glad to but mary would have given me no peace till i asked them any way the ladies aid is going to clean the manse from top to bottom before the bride and groom come back and norman douglas has arranged to fill the cellar with vegetables nobody ever saw or heard anything quite like norman douglas these days believe me hes so tickled that hes going to marry ellen west after wanting her all his life if i was ellen but then im not and if she is satisfied i can very well be i heard her say years ago when she was a schoolgirl that she didnt want a tame puppy for a husband theres nothing tame about norman believe me  the sun was setting over rainbow valley the pond was wearing a wonderful tissue of purple and gold and green and crimson a faint blue haze rested on the eastern hill over which a great pale round moon was just floating up like a silver bubble  they were all there squatted in the little open glade faith and una jerry and carl jem and walter nan and di and mary vance they had been having a special celebration for it would be jems last evening in rainbow valley on the morrow he would leave for charlottetown to attend queens academy their charmed circle would be broken and in spite of the jollity of their little festival there was a hint of sorrow in every gay young heart  see there is a great golden palace over there in the sunset said walter pointing look at the shining tower and the crimson banners streaming from them perhaps a conqueror is riding home from battle and they are hanging them out to do honour to him  oh i wish we had the old days back again exclaimed jem id love to be a soldier a great triumphant general id give everything to see a big battle  well jem was to be a soldier and see a greater battle than had ever been fought in the world but that was as yet far in the future and the mother whose first born son he was was wont to look on her boys and thank god that the brave days of old which jem longed for were gone for ever and that never would it be necessary for the sons of canada to ride forth to battle for the ashes of their fathers and the temples of their gods  the shadow of the great conflict had not yet made felt any forerunner of its chill the lads who were to fight and perhaps fall on the fields of france and flanders gallipoli and palestine were still roguish schoolboys with a fair life in prospect before them  the girls whose hearts were to be wrung were yet fair little maidens a star with hopes and dreams  slowly the banners of the sunset city gave up their crimson and gold slowly the conquerors pageant faded out twilight crept over the valley and the little group grew silent walter had been reading again that day in his beloved book of myths and he remembered how he had once fancied the pied piper coming down the valley on an evening just like this  he began to speak dreamily partly because he wanted to thrill his companions a little partly because something apart from him seemed to be speaking through his lips  the piper is coming nearer he said he is nearer than he was that evening i saw him before his long shadowy cloak is blowing around him he pipes he pipes and we must follow jem and carl and jerry and i round and round the world listen listen cant you hear his wild music  the girls shivered  you know youre only pretending protested mary vance and i wish you wouldnt you make it too real i hate that old piper of yours  but jem sprang up with a gay laugh he stood up on a little hillock tall and splendid with his open brow and his fearless eyes there were thousands like him all over the land of the maple  let the piper come and welcome he cried waving his hand ill follow him gladly round and round the world"@"rainbow vally"@"lucy maud montgomery"
