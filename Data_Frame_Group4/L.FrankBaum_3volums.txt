afterward    1  once on a time  i am going to tell a story one of those tales of astonishing adventures that happened years and years and years ago  perhaps you wonder why it is that so many stories are told of once on a time and so few of these days in which we live but that is easily explained  in the old days when the world was young there were no automobiles nor flying-machines to make one wonder nor were there railway trains nor telephones nor mechanical inventions of any sort to keep people keyed up to a high pitch of excitement  men and women lived simply and quietly  they were nature's children and breathed fresh air into their lungs instead of smoke and coal gas and tramped through green meadows and deep forests instead of riding in street cars and went to bed when it grew dark and rose with the sun which is vastly different from the present custom  having no books to read they told their adventures to one another and to their little ones and the stories were handed down from generation to generation and reverently believed  those who peopled the world in the old days having nothing but their hands to depend on were to a certain extent helpless and so the fairies were sorry for them and ministered to their wants patiently and frankly often showing themselves to those they befriended  so people knew fairies in those days my dear and loved them together with all the ryls and knooks and pixies and nymphs and other beings that belong to the hordes of immortals  and a fairy tale was a thing to be wondered at and spoken of in awed whispers for no one thought of doubting its truth  to-day the fairies are shy for so many curious inventions of men have come into use that the wonders of fairyland are somewhat tame beside them and even the boys and girls can not be so easily interested or surprised as in the old days  so the sweet and gentle little immortals perform their tasks unseen and unknown and live mostly in their own beautiful realms where they are almost unthought of by our busy bustling world  yet when we come to story-telling the marvels of our own age shrink into insignificance beside the brave deeds and absorbing experiences of the days when fairies were better known and so we go back to once on a time for the tales that we most love and that children have ever loved since mankind knew that fairies exist    2  the enchanted isle  once there was an enchanted island in the middle of the sea  it was called the isle of yew  and in it were five important kingdoms ruled by men and many woodland dells and forest glades and pleasant meadows and grim mountains inhabited by fairies  from the fairies some of the men had learned wonderful secrets and had become magicians and sorcerers with powers so great that the entire island was reputed to be one of enchantments  who these men were the common people did not always know for while some were kings and rulers others lived quietly hidden away in forests or mountains and seldom or never showed themselves  indeed there were not so many of these magicians as people thought only it was so hard to tell them from common folk that every stranger was regarded with a certain amount of curiosity and fear  the island was round like a mince pie  and it was divided into four quarters also like a pie except that there was a big place in the center where the fifth kingdom called spor lay in the midst of the mountains  spor was ruled by king terribus whom no one but his own subjects had ever seen and not many of them  for no one was allowed to enter the kingdom of spor and its king never left his palace  but the people of spor had a bad habit of rushing down from their mountains and stealing the goods of the inhabitants of the other four kingdoms and carrying them home with them without offering any apologies whatever for such horrid conduct  sometimes those they robbed tried to fight them but they were a terrible people consisting of giants with huge clubs and dwarfs who threw flaming darts and the stern gray men of spor who were most frightful of all  so as a rule every one fled before them and the people were thankful that the fierce warriors of spor seldom came to rob them oftener than once a year  it was on this account that all who could afford the expense built castles to live in with stone walls so thick that even the giants of spor could not batter them down  and the children were not allowed to stray far from home for fear some roving band of robbers might steal them and make their parents pay large sums for their safe return  yet for all this the people of the enchanted isle of yew were happy and prosperous  no grass was greener no forests more cool and delightful no skies more sunny no sea more blue and rippling than theirs  and the nations of the world envied them but dared not attempt to conquer an island abounding in enchantments    3  the fairy bower  that part of the enchanted isle which was kissed by the rising sun was called dawna the kingdom that was tinted rose and purple by the setting sun was known as auriel and the southland where fruits and flowers abounded was the kingdom of plenta  up at the north lay heg the home of the great barons who feared not even the men of spor and in the kingdom of heg our story opens  upon a beautiful plain stood the castle of the great baron merd renowned alike in war and peace and second in importance only to the king of heg  it was a castle of vast extent built with thick walls and protected by strong gates  in front of it sloped a pretty stretch of land with the sea glistening far beyond and back of it but a short distance away was the edge of the forest of lurla  one fair summer day the custodian of the castle gates opened a wicket and let down a draw-bridge when out trooped three pretty girls with baskets dangling on their arms  one of the maids walked in front of her companions as became the only daughter of the mighty baron merd she was named seseley and had yellow hair and red cheeks and big blue eyes  behind her merry and laughing yet with a distinct deference to the high station of their young lady walked berna and helda dark brunettes with mischievous eyes and slender lithe limbs  berna was the daughter of the chief archer and helda the niece of the captain of the guard and they were appointed play-fellows and comrades of the fair seseley  up the hill to the forest's edge ran the three and then without hesitation plunged into the shade of the ancient trees  there was no sunlight now but the air was cool and fragrant of nuts and mosses and the children skipped along the paths joyously and without fear  to be sure the forest of lurla was well known as the home of fairies but seseley and her comrades feared nothing from such gentle creatures and only longed for an interview with the powerful immortals whom they had been taught to love as the tender guardians of mankind  nymphs there were in lurla as well and crooked knooks it was said yet for many years past no person could boast the favor of meeting any one of the fairy creatures face to face  so gathering a few nuts here and a sweet forest flower there the three maidens walked farther and farther into the forest until they came upon a clearing formed like a circle with mosses and ferns for its carpet and great overhanging branches for its roof  how pretty cried seseley gaily  let us eat our luncheon in this lovely banquet-hall  so berna and helda spread a cloth and brought from their baskets some golden platters and a store of food  yet there was little ceremony over the meal you may be sure and within a short space all the children had satisfied their appetites and were laughing and chatting as merrily as if they were at home in the great castle  indeed it is certain they were happier in their forest glade than when facing grim walls of stone and the three were in such gay spirits that whatever one chanced to say the others promptly joined in laughing over  soon however they were startled to hear a silvery peal of laughter answering their own and turning to see whence the sound proceeded they found seated near them a creature so beautiful that at once the three pairs of eyes opened to their widest extent and three hearts beat much faster than before  well i must say you do stare exclaimed the newcomer who was clothed in soft floating robes of rose and pearl color and whose eyes shone upon them like two stars  forgive our impertinence answered the little lady seseley trying to appear dignified and unmoved but you must acknowledge that you came among us uninvited and and you are certainly rather odd in appearance  again the silvery laughter rang through the glade  uninvited echoed the creature clapping her hands together delightedly uninvited to my own forest home  why my dear girls you are the uninvited ones indeed you are to thus come romping into our fairy bower  the children did not open their eyes any wider on hearing this speech for they could not but their faces expressed their amazement fully while helda gasped the words   a fairy bower  we are in a fairy bower  most certainly was the reply  and as for being odd in appearance let me ask how you could reasonably expect a fairy to appear as mortal maidens do  a fairy exclaimed seseley  are you then a real fairy  i regret to say i am returned the other more soberly as she patted a moss-bank with a silver-tipped wand  then for a moment there was silence while the three girls sat very still and stared at their immortal companion with evident curiosity finally seseley asked   why do you regret being a fairy  i have always thought them the happiest creatures in the world  perhaps we ought to be happy answered the fairy gravely for we have wonderful powers and do much to assist you helpless mortals  and i suppose some of us really are happy  but for my part i am so utterly tired of a fairy life that i would do anything to change it  that is strange declared berna  you seem very young to be already discontented with your lot  now at this the fairy burst into laughter again and presently asked   how old do you think me  about our own age said berna after a glance at her and a moment's reflection  nonsense retorted the fairy sharply  these trees are hundreds of years old yet i remember when they were mere twigs  and i remember when mortals first came to live upon this island yes and when this island was first created and rose from the sea after a great earthquake  i remember for many many centuries my dears  i have grown tired of remembering and of being a fairy continually without any change to brighten my life  to be sure said seseley with sympathy  i never thought of fairy life in that way before  it must get to be quite tiresome  and think of the centuries i must yet live exclaimed the fairy in a dismal voice  isn't it an awful thing to look forward to  it is indeed agreed seseley  i'd be glad to exchange lives with you said helda looking at the fairy with intense admiration  but you can't do that answered the little creature quickly mortals can't become fairies you know although i believe there was once a mortal who was made immortal  but fairies can become anything they desire cried berna  oh no they can't  you are mistaken if you believe that was the reply  i could change you into a fly or a crocodile or a bobolink if i wanted to but fairies can't change themselves into anything else  how strange murmured seseley much impressed  but you can cried the fairy jumping up and coming toward them you are mortals and by the laws that govern us a mortal can change a fairy into anything she pleases  oh said seseley filled with amazement at the idea  the fairy fell on her knees before the baron's daughter please please dear seseley she pleaded change me into a mortal    4  prince marvel  it is easy to imagine the astonishment of the three girls at hearing this strange request  they gazed in a bewildered fashion upon the kneeling fairy and were at first unable to answer one word  then seseley said sadly for she grieved to disappoint the pretty creature   we are but mortal children and have no powers of enchantment at all  ah that is true so far as concerns yourselves replied the fairy eagerly yet mortals may easily transform fairies into anything they wish  if that is so why have we never heard of this power before asked seseley  because fairies as a rule are content with their lot and do not wish to appear in any form but their own  and knowing that evil or mischievous mortals can transform them at will the fairies take great care to remain invisible so they can not be interfered with  have you ever she asked suddenly seen a fairy before  never replied seseley  nor would you have seen me to-day had i not known you were kind and pure-hearted or had i not resolved to ask you to exercise your powers upon me  i must say remarked helda boldly that you are foolish to wish to become anything different from what you are  for you are very beautiful now added berna admiringly  beautiful retorted the fairy with a little frown what does beauty amount to if one is to remain invisible  not much that is true agreed berna smoothing her own dark locks  and as for being foolish continued the fairy i ought to be allowed to act foolishly if i want to  for centuries past i have not had a chance to do a single foolish thing  poor dear said helda softly  seseley had listened silently to this conversation  now she inquired   what do you wish to become  a mortal answered the fairy promptly  a girl like ourselves questioned the baron's daughter  perhaps said the fairy as if undecided  then you would be likely to endure many privations said seseley gently  for you would have neither father nor mother to befriend you nor any house to live in  and if you hired your services to some baron you would be obliged to wash dishes all day or mend clothing or herd cattle said berna  but i should travel all over the island said the fairy brightly and that is what i long to do  i do not care to work  i fear a girl would not be allowed to travel alone seseley remarked after some further thought  at least she added i have never heard of such a thing  no said the fairy rather bitterly your men are the ones that roam abroad and have adventures of all kinds  your women are poor weak creatures i remember  there was no denying this so the three girls sat silent until seseley asked   why do you wish to become a mortal  to gain exciting experiences answered the fairy  i'm tired of being a humdrum fairy year in and year out  of course i do not wish to become a mortal for all time for that would get monotonous too but to live a short while as the earth people do would amuse me very much  if you want variety you should become a boy said helda with a laugh the life of a boy is one round of excitement  then make me a boy exclaimed the fairy eagerly  a boy they all cried in consternation  and seseley added   why you're a girl fairy aren't you  well yes i suppose i am answered the beautiful creature smiling but as you are going to change me anyway i may as well become a boy as a girl  better declared helda clapping her hands for then you can do as you please  but would it be right asked seseley with hesitation  why not retorted the fairy  i can see nothing wrong in being a boy  make me a tall slender youth with waving brown hair and dark eyes  then i shall be as unlike my own self as possible and the adventure will be all the more interesting  yes i like the idea of being a boy very much indeed  but i don't know how to transform you some one will have to show me the way to do it protested seseley who was getting worried over the task set her  oh that will be easy enough returned the little immortal  have you a wand  no  then i'll loan you mine for i shall not need it  and you must wave it over my head three times and say  'by my mortal powers i transform you into a boy for the space of one year'  one year  isn't that too long  it's a very short time to one who has lived thousands of years as a fairy  that is true answered the baron's daughter  now i'll begin by doing a little transforming myself said the fairy getting upon her feet again and you can watch and see how i do it  she brushed a bit of moss from her gauzy skirts and continued  if i'm to become a boy i shall need a horse you know  a handsome prancing steed very fleet of foot  a moment she stood motionless as if listening  then she uttered a low but shrill whistle  the three girls filled with eager interest watched her intently  presently a trampling of footsteps was heard through the brushwood and a beautiful deer burst from the forest and fearlessly ran to the fairy without hesitation she waved her wand above the deer's head and exclaimed   by all my fairy powers i command you to become a war-horse for the period of one year  instantly the deer disappeared and in its place was a handsome charger milk-white in color with flowing mane and tail  upon its back was a saddle sparkling with brilliant gems sewn upon fine dressed leather  the girls uttered cries of astonishment and delight and the fairy said   you see these transformations are not at all difficult  i must now have a sword  she plucked a twig from a near-by tree and cast it upon the ground at her feet  again she waved her wand and the twig turned to a gleaming sword richly engraved that seemed to the silent watchers to tremble slightly in its sheath as if its heart of steel throbbed with hopes of battles to come  and now i must have shield and armor said the fairy gaily  this will make a shield and she stripped a sheet of loose bark from a tree-trunk but for armor i must have something better  will you give me your cloak  this appeal was made to seseley and the baron's daughter drew her white velvet cloak from her shoulders and handed it to the fairy  a moment later it was transformed into a suit of glittering armor that seemed fashioned of pure silver inlaid with gold while the sheet of bark at the same time became a handsome shield with the figures of three girls graven upon it  seseley recognized the features as those of herself and her comrades and noted also that they appeared sitting at the edge of a forest the great trees showing plainly in the background  i shall be your champion you see laughed the fairy gleefully and maybe i shall be able to repay you for the loss of your cloak  i do not mind the cloak returned the child who had been greatly interested in these strange transformations  but it seems impossible that a dainty little girl like you can ride this horse and carry these heavy arms  i'll not be a girl much longer said the little creature  here take my wand and transform me into a noble youth  again the pretty fairy kneeled before seseley her dainty rounded limbs of white and rose showing plainly through her gauzy attire  and the baron's daughter was suddenly inspired to be brave not wishing to disappoint the venturous immortal  so she rose and took the magic wand in her hand waving it three times above the head of the fairy  by my powers as a mortal she said marveling even then at the strange speech i command you to become a brave and gallant youth handsome strong fearless  and such shall you remain for the space of one year  as she ceased speaking the fairy was gone and a slender youth dark-eyed and laughing was holding her hand in his and kissing it gratefully  i thank you most lovely maiden he said in a pleasant voice for giving me a place in the world of mortals  i shall ride at once in search of adventure but my good sword is ever at your service  with this he gracefully arose and began to buckle on his magnificent armor and to fasten the sword to his belt  seseley drew a long sighing breath of amazement at her own powers and turning to berna and helda she asked   do i see aright  is the little fairy really transformed to this youth  it certainly seems so returned helda who being unabashed by the marvels she had beheld turned to gaze boldly upon the young knight  do you still remember that a moment ago you were a fairy she inquired  yes indeed said he smiling and i am really a fairy now being but changed in outward form  but no one must know this save yourselves until the year has expired and i resume my true station will you promise to guard my secret  oh yes they exclaimed in chorus  for they were delighted as any children might well be at having so remarkable a secret to keep and talk over among themselves  i must ask one more favor continued the youth  that you give me a name for in this island i believe all men bear names of some sort to distinguish them one from another  true said seseley thoughtfully  what were you called as a fairy  that does not matter in the least he answered hastily  i must have an entirely new name  suppose we call him the silver knight suggested berna as she eyed his glistening armor  oh no that is no name at all declared helda  we might better call him baron strongarm  i do not like that either said the lady seseley for we do not know whether his arm is strong or not  but he has been transformed in a most astonishing and bewildering manner before our very eyes and i think the name of prince marvel would suit him very well  excellent cried the youth picking up his richly graven shield the name seems fitting in every way  and for a year i shall be known to all this island as prince marvel    5  the king of thieves  old marshelm the captain of the guard was much surprised when he saw the baron's daughter and her playmates approach her father's castle escorted by a knight in glittering armor  to be sure it was a rather small knight but the horse he led by the bridle was so stately and magnificent in appearance that old marshelm who was an excellent judge of horses at once decided the stranger must be a personage of unusual importance  as they came nearer the captain of the guard also observed the beauty of the little knight's armor and caught the glint of jewels set in the handle of his sword so he called his men about him and prepared to receive the knight with the honors doubtless due his high rank  but to the captain's disappointment the stranger showed no intention of entering the castle  on the contrary he kissed the little lady seseley's hand respectfully waved an adieu to the others and then mounted his charger and galloped away over the plains  the drawbridge was let down to permit the three children to enter and the great baron merd came himself to question his daughter  who was the little knight he asked  his name is prince marvel answered seseley demurely  prince marvel exclaimed the baron  i have never heard of him does he come from the kingdom of dawna or that of auriel or plenta  that i do not know said seseley with truth  where did you meet him continued the baron  in the forest my father and he kindly escorted us home  hm muttered the baron thoughtfully  did he say what adventure brought him to our kingdom of heg  no father  but he mentioned being in search of adventure  oh he'll find enough to busy him in this wild island where every man he meets would rather draw his sword than eat returned the old warrior smiling  how old may this prince marvel be  he looks not over fifteen years of age said seseley uneasy at so much questioning for she did not wish to be forced to tell an untruth but it is possible he is much older she added beginning to get confused  well well i am sorry he did not pay my castle a visit declared the baron  he is very small and slight to be traveling this dangerous country alone and i might have advised him as to his welfare  seseley thought that prince marvel would need no advice from any one as to his conduct but she wisely refrained from speaking this thought and the old baron walked away to glance through a slit in the stone wall at the figure of the now distant knight  prince marvel was riding swiftly toward the brow of the hill and shortly his great war-horse mounted the ascent and disappeared on its farther slope  the youth's heart was merry and light and he reflected joyously as he rode along that a whole year of freedom and fascinating adventure lay before him  the valley in which he now found himself was very beautiful the soft grass beneath his horse's feet being sprinkled with bright flowers while clumps of trees stood here and there to break the monotony of the landscape  for an hour the prince rode along rejoicing in the free motion of his horse and breathing in the perfume-laden air  then he found he had crossed the valley and was approaching a series of hills  these were broken by huge rocks the ground being cluttered with boulders of rough stone  his horse speedily found a pathway leading through these rocks but was obliged to proceed at a walk turning first one way and then another as the path zigzagged up the hill  presently being engaged in deep thought and little noting the way prince marvel rode between two high walls of rock standing so close together that horse and rider could scarcely pass between the sides having traversed this narrow space some distance the wall opened suddenly upon a level plat of ground where grass and trees grew  it was not a very big place but was surely the end of the path as all around it stood bare walls so high and steep that neither horse nor man could climb them  in the side of the rocky wall facing the entrance the traveler noticed a hollow like the mouth of a cave across which was placed an iron gate  and above the gateway was painted in red letters on the gray stone the following words                wul-takim          king of thieves                           his treasure house              keep out   prince marvel laughed on reading this and after getting down from his saddle he advanced to the iron gate and peered through its heavy bars  i have no idea who this wul-takim is he said for i know nothing at all of the ways of men outside the forest in which i have always dwelt but thieves are bad people i am quite sure and since wul-takim is the king of thieves he must be by far the worst man on this island  then he saw through the bars of the gate that a great cavern lay beyond in which were stacked treasures of all sorts  rich cloths golden dishes and ornaments gemmed coronets and bracelets cleverly forged armor shields and battle-axes  also there were casks and bales of merchandise of every sort  the gate appeared to have no lock so prince marvel opened it and walked in  then he perceived perched on the very top of a pyramid of casks the form of a boy who sat very still and watched him with a look of astonishment upon his face  what are you doing up there asked the prince  nothing said the boy  if i moved the least little bit this pile of casks would topple over and i should be thrown to the ground  well returned the prince what of it  but just then he glanced at the ground and saw why the boy did not care to tumble down  for in the earth were planted many swords with their sharp blades pointing upward and to fall upon these meant serious wounds and perhaps death  oh ho cried marvel i begin to understand  you are a prisoner  yes as you will also be shortly answered the boy  and then you will understand another thing that you were very reckless ever to enter this cave  why inquired the prince who really knew little of the world and was interested in everything he saw and heard  because it is the stronghold of the robber king and when you opened that gate you caused a bell to ring far down on the hillside  so the robbers are now warned that an enemy is in their cave and they will soon arrive to make you a prisoner even as i am  ah i see said the prince with a laugh it is a rather clever contrivance but having been warned in time i should indeed be foolish to be caught in such a trap  with this he half drew his sword but thinking that robbers were not worthy to be slain with its untarnished steel he pushed it back into the jeweled scabbard and looked around for another weapon  a stout oaken staff lay upon the ground and this he caught up and ran with it from the cave placing himself just beside the narrow opening that led into this rock-encompassed plain  for he quickly saw that this was the only way any one could enter or leave the place and therefore knew the robbers were coming up the narrow gorge even as he had himself done  soon they were heard stumbling along at a rapid pace crying to one another to make haste and catch the intruder  the first that came through the opening received so sharp a blow upon the head from prince marvel's oak staff that he fell to the ground and lay still while the next was treated in a like manner and fell beside his comrade  perhaps the thieves had not expected so sturdy an enemy for they continued to rush through the opening in the rocks and to fall beneath the steady blows of the prince's staff until every one of them lay senseless before the victor  at first they had piled themselves upon one another very neatly but the pile got so high at last that the prince was obliged to assist the last thieves to leap to the top of the heap before they completely lost their senses  i have no doubt our prince feeling himself yet strange in the new form he had acquired and freshly transported from the forest glades in which he had always lived was fully as much astonished at his deed of valor as were the robbers themselves and if he shuddered a little when looking upon the heap of senseless thieves you must forgive him this weakness  for he straightway resolved to steel his heart to such sights and to be every bit as stern and severe as a mortal knight would have been  throwing down his staff he ran to the cave again and stepping between the sword points he approached the pile of casks and held out his arms to the boy who was perched upon the top  the thieves are conquered he cried  jump down  i won't said the boy  why not inquired the prince  can't you see i'm very miserable asked the boy in return don't you understand that every minute i expect to fall upon those sword points  but i will catch you cried the prince  i don't want you to catch me said the boy  i want to be miserable it's the first chance i've ever had and i'm enjoying my misery very much  this speech so astonished prince marvel that for a moment he stood motionless  then he retorted angrily   you're a fool  if i wasn't so miserable up here i'd come down and thrash you for that said the boy with a sigh  this answer so greatly annoyed prince marvel that he gave the central cask of the pyramid a sudden push and the next moment the casks were tumbling in every direction while the boy fell headlong in their midst  but marvel caught him deftly in his arms and so saved him from the sword points  there he said standing the boy upon his feet now you are released from your misery  and i should be glad to punish you for your interference declared the boy gloomily eying his preserver had you not saved my life by catching me  according to the code of honor of knighthood i can not harm one who has saved my life until i have returned the obligation therefore for the present i shall pardon your insulting speeches and actions  but you have also saved my life answered prince marvel for had you not warned me of the robbers' return they would surely have caught me  true said the boy brightening up therefore our score is now even but take care not to affront me again for hereafter i will show you no mercy  prince marvel looked at the boy with wonder  he was about his own size yet strong and well formed and he would have been handsome except for the expression of discontent upon his face  yet his manner and words were so absurd and unnatural that the prince was more amused than angered by his new acquaintance and presently laughed in his face  if all the people in this island are like you he said i shall have lots of fun with them  and you are only a boy after all  i'm bigger than you declared the other glaring fiercely at the prince  how much bigger asked marvel his eyes twinkling  oh ever so much  then fetch along that coil of rope and follow me said prince marvel  fetch the rope yourself retorted the boy bluntly  i'm not your servant then he put his hands in his pockets and coolly walked out of the cave to look at the pile of senseless robbers  prince marvel made no reply but taking the coil of rope on his shoulder he carried it to where the thieves lay and threw it down beside them  then he cut lengths from the coil with his sword and bound the limbs of each robber securely  within a half-hour he had laid out a row of thieves extending half way across the grassy plain and on counting their number he found he had captured fifty-nine of them  this task being accomplished and the robbers rendered helpless prince marvel turned to the boy who stood watching him  get a suit of armor from the cave and a strong sword and then return here he said in a stern voice  why should i do that asked the boy rather impudently  because i am going to fight you for disobeying my orders and if you do not protect yourself i shall probably kill you  that sounds pleasant said the boy  but if you should prove my superior in skill i beg you will not kill me at once but let me die a lingering death  why asked the prince  because i shall suffer more and that will be delightful  i am not anxious to kill you nor to make you suffer said marvel all that i ask is that you acknowledge me your master  i won't answered the boy  i acknowledge no master in all the world  then you must fight declared the prince gravely  if you win i will promise to serve you faithfully and if i conquer you then you must acknowledge me your master and obey my commands  agreed cried the boy with sudden energy and he rushed into the cave and soon returned clad in armor and bearing a sword and shield on the shield was pictured a bolt of lightning  lightning will soon strike those three girls whose champion you seem to be he said tauntingly  the three girls defy your lightning returned the prince with a smile  i see you are brave enough  brave  why should i not be answered the boy proudly  i am the lord nerle the son of neggar the chief baron of heg  the other bowed low  i am pleased to know your station he said  i am called prince marvel and this is my first adventure  and likely to be your last exclaimed the boy sneeringly  for i am stronger than you and i have fought many times with full grown men  are you ready asked prince marvel for answer  yes  then the swords clashed and sparks flew from the blades  but it was not for long  suddenly nerle's sword went flying through the air and shattered its blade against a wall of rock  he scowled at prince marvel a moment who smiled back at him  then the boy rushed into the cave and returned with another sword  scarcely had the weapons crossed again when with a sudden blow prince marvel snapped nerle's blade in two and followed this up with a sharp slap upon his ear with the flat of his own sword that fairly bewildered the boy and made him sit down on the grass to think what had happened to him  then prince marvel's merry laugh rang far across the hills and so delighted was he at the astonished expression upon nerle's face that it was many minutes before he could control his merriment and ask his foeman if he had had enough fight  i suppose i have replied the boy rubbing his ear tenderly  that blow stings most deliciously  but it is a hard thought that the son of baron neggar should serve prince marvel  do not worry about that said the prince for i assure you my rank is so far above your own that it is no degradation for the son of neggar to serve me  but come we must dispose of these thieves  what is the proper fate for such men  they are always hanged answered nerle getting upon his feet  well there are trees handy remarked the prince although his girlish heart insisted on making him shiver in spite of his resolve to be manly and stern  let us get to work and hang them as soon as possible  and then we can proceed upon our journey  nerle now willingly lent his assistance to his new master and soon they had placed a rope around the neck of each thief and were ready to dangle them all from the limbs of the trees  but at this juncture the thieves began to regain consciousness and now wul-takim the big red-bearded king of the thieves sat up and asked   who is our conqueror  prince marvel answered nerle  and what army assisted him inquired wul-takim curiously gazing upon the prince  he conquered you alone and single-handed said nerle  hearing this the big king began to weep bitterly and the tear-drops ran down his face in such a stream that prince marvel ordered nerle to wipe them away with his handkerchief as the thief's hands were tied behind his back  to think sobbed wul-takim miserably only to think that after all my terrible deeds and untold wickedness i have been captured by a mere boy  oh boo-hoo boo-hoo boo-hoo  it is a terrible disgrace  you will not have to bear it long said the prince soothingly  i am going to hang you in a few minutes  thanks  thank you very much answered the king ceasing to weep  i have always expected to be hanged some day and i am glad no one but you two boys will witness me when my feet begin kicking about  i shall not kick declared another of the thieves who had also regained his senses  i shall sing while i am being hanged  but you can not my good gunder protested the king for the rope will cut off your breath and no man can sing without breath  then i shall whistle said gunder composedly  the king cast at him a look of reproach and turning to prince marvel he said   it will be a great task to string up so many thieves  you look tired permit me to assist you to hang the others and then i will climb into a tree and hang myself from a strong branch with as little bother as possible  oh i won't think of troubling you exclaimed marvel with a laugh having conquered you alone i feel it my duty to hang you without assistance save that of my esquire  it's no trouble i assure you but suit your own convenience said the thief carelessly  then he cast his eye toward the cave and asked  what will you do with all our treasure  give it to the poor said prince marvel promptly  what poor  oh the poorest people i can find  will you permit me to advise you in this matter asked the king of thieves politely  yes indeed for i am a stranger in this land returned the prince  well i know a lot of people who are so poor that they have no possessions whatever neither food to eat houses to live in nor any clothing but that which covers their bodies  they can call no man friend nor will any lift a hand to help them  indeed good sir i verily believe they will soon perish miserably unless you come to their assistance  poor creatures exclaimed prince marvel with ready sympathy tell me who they are and i will divide amongst them all your ill-gotten gains  they are ourselves replied the king of thieves with a sigh  marvel looked at him in amazement and then burst into joyous laughter  yourselves he cried greatly amused  indeed yes said wul-takim sadly  there are no poorer people in all the world for we have ropes about our necks and are soon to be hanged  to-morrow we shall not have even our flesh left for the crows will pick our bones  that is true remarked marvel thoughtfully  but if i restore to you the treasure how will it benefit you since you are about to die  must you really hang us asked the thief  yes i have decreed it and you deserve your fate  why  because you have wickedly taken from helpless people their property and committed many other crimes besides  but i have reformed  we have all reformed have we not brothers  we have answered the other thieves who having regained their senses were listening to this conversation with much interest  and if you will return to us our treasure we will promise never to steal again but to remain honest men and enjoy our wealth in peace promised the king  honest men could not enjoy treasures they have stolen said prince marvel  true but this treasure is now yours having been won by you in fair battle  and if you present it to us it will no longer be stolen treasure but a generous gift from a mighty prince which we may enjoy with clear consciences  yet there remains the fact that i have promised to hang you suggested prince marvel with a smile for the king amused him greatly  not at all  not at all cried wul-takim  you promised to hang fifty-nine thieves and there is no doubt the fifty-nine thieves deserved to be hung  but consider  we have all reformed our ways and become honest men so it would be a sad and unkindly act to hang fifty-nine honest men  what think you nerle asked the prince turning to his esquire  why the rogue seems to speak truth said nerle scratching his head with a puzzled air yet if he speaks truth there is little difference between a rogue and an honest man  ask him my master what caused them all to reform so suddenly  because we were about to die and we thought it a good way to save our lives replied the robber king  that's an honest answer anyway said nerle  perhaps sir they have really reformed  and if so i will not have the death of fifty-nine honest men on my conscience declared the prince  then he turned to wul-takim and added  i will release you and give you the treasure as you request but you owe me allegiance from this time forth and if i ever hear of your becoming thieves again i promise to return and hang every one of you  never fear answered wul-takim joyfully  it is hard work to steal and while we have so much treasure it is wholly unnecessary  moreover having accepted from you our lives and our fortunes we shall hereafter be your devoted servants and whenever you need our services you have but to call upon us and we will support you loyally and gladly  i accept your service answered the prince graciously  and then he unbound the fifty-nine honest men and took the ropes from their necks  as nightfall was fast approaching the new servants set to work to prepare a great feast in honor of their master  it was laid in the middle of the grassy clearing that all might sit around and celebrate the joyous occasion  do you think you can trust these men asked nerle suspiciously  why not replied the prince  they have been exceedingly wicked it is true but they are now intent upon being exceedingly good  let us encourage them in this  if we mistrusted all who have ever done an evil act there would be fewer honest people in the world  and if it were as interesting to do a good act as an evil one there is no doubt every one would choose the good    6  the troubles of nerle  that night prince marvel slept within the cave surrounded by the fifty-nine reformed thieves and suffered no harm at their hands  in the morning accompanied by his esquire nerle who was mounted upon a spirited horse brought him by wul-takim he charged the honest men to remember their promises bade them good by and set out in search of further adventure  as they left the clearing by the narrow passage that led between the overhanging rocks the prince looked back and saw that the sign above the gate of the cave which had told of the thieves' treasure house had been changed  it now read as follows                wul-takim         king of honest men                           his pleasure house              walk in   that is much better laughed the prince  i accomplished some good by my adventure anyway  nerle did not reply  he seemed especially quiet and thoughtful as he rode by his master's side and after they had traveled some distance in silence prince marvel said   tell me how you came to be in the cave of thieves and perched upon the casks where i found you  it is a sad story returned nerle with a sigh but since you request me to tell it the tale may serve to relieve the tedium of your journey  my father is a mighty baron very wealthy and with a heart so kind that he has ever taken pleasure in thrusting on me whatever gift he could think of  i had not a single desire unsatisfied for before i could wish for anything it was given me  my mother was much like my father  she and her women were always making jams jellies candies cakes and the like for me to eat so i never knew the pleasure of hunger  my clothes were the gayest satins and velvets richly made and sewn with gold and silver braid so it was impossible to wish for more in the way of apparel  they let me study my lessons whenever i felt like it and go fishing or hunting as i pleased so i could not complain that i was unable to do just as i wanted to  all the servants obeyed my slightest wish  if i wanted to sit up late at night no one objected if i wished to lie in bed till noon they kept the house quiet so as not to disturb me  this condition of affairs as you may imagine grew more and more tedious and exasperating the older i became  try as i might i could find nothing to complain of  i once saw the son of one of our servants receive a flogging and my heart grew light  i immediately begged my father to flog me by way of variety and he who could refuse me nothing at once consented  for this reason there was less satisfaction in the operation than i had expected although for the time being it was a distinct novelty  now no one could expect a high-spirited boy to put up with such a life as mine  with nothing to desire and no chance of doing anything that would annoy my parents my days were dreary indeed  he paused to wipe the tears from his eyes and the prince murmured sympathetically  poor boy  poor boy  ah you may well say that continued nerle  but one day a stranger came to my father's castle with tales of many troubles he had met with he had been lost in a forest and nearly starved to death  he had been robbed and beaten and left wounded and sore by the wayside  he had begged from door to door and been refused food or assistance  in short his story was so delightful that it made me envy him and i yearned to suffer as he had done  when i could speak with him alone i said  'pray tell me how i can manage to acquire the misfortunes you have undergone  here i have everything that i desire and it makes me very unhappy'  the stranger laughed at me at first and i found some pleasure in the humiliation i then felt  but it did not last long for presently he grew sober and advised me to run away from home and seek adventure  'once away from your father's castle' said he 'troubles will fall upon you thick enough to satisfy even your longings'  'that is what i am afraid of' i answered  'i don't want to be satisfied even with troubles  what i seek is unsatisfied longings'  'nevertheless' said he 'i advise you to travel  everything will probably go wrong with you and then you will be happy'  i acted upon the stranger's advice and ran away from home the next day  after journeying a long time i commenced to feel the pangs of hunger and was just beginning to enjoy myself when a knight rode by and gave me a supply of food  at this rebuff i could not restrain my tears but while i wept my horse stumbled and threw me over his head i hoped at first i had broken my neck and was just congratulating myself upon the misfortune when a witch-woman came along and rubbed some ointment upon my bruises in spite of my protests  to my great grief the pain left me and i was soon well again  but as a slight compensation for my disappointment my horse had run away so i began my journey anew and on foot  that afternoon i stepped into a nest of wasps but the thoughtless creatures flew away without stinging me  then i met a fierce tiger and my heart grew light and gay  'surely this will cause me suffering' i cried and advanced swiftly upon the brute  but the cowardly tiger turned tail and ran to hide in the bushes leaving me unhurt  of course my many disappointments were some consolation but not much  that night i slept on the bare ground and hoped i should catch a severe cold but no such joy was to be mine  yet the next afternoon i experienced my first pleasure  the thieves caught me stripped off all my fine clothes and jewels and beat me well  then they carried me to their cave dressed me in rags and perched me on the top of the casks where the slightest movement on my part would send me tumbling among the sword points  this was really delightful and i was quite happy until you came and released me  i thought then that i might gain some pleasure by provoking you to anger and our fight was the result  that blow on the ear was exquisite and by forcing me to become your servant you have made me for the first time in my life almost contented  for i hope in your company to experience a great many griefs and disappointments  as nerle concluded his story prince marvel turned to him and grasped his hand  accept my sympathy said he  i know exactly how you feel for my own life during the past few centuries has not been much different  the past few centuries gasped nerle  what do you mean  at this the prince blushed seeing he had nearly disclosed his secret but he said quickly   does it not seem centuries when one is unhappy  it does indeed responded nerle earnestly  but please tell me your story  not now said prince marvel with a smile  it will please you to desire in vain to hear a tale i will not tell  yet i promise that on the day we part company i shall inform you who i am    7  the gray men  the adventurers gave no heed to the path they followed after leaving the cave of the reformed thieves but their horses accidentally took the direction of the foot-hills that led into the wild interior kingdom of spor  therefore the travelers when they had finished their conversation and begun to look about them found themselves in a rugged mountainous country that was wholly unlike the green plains of heg they had left behind  now as i have before said the most curious and fearful of the island people dwelt in this kingdom of spor  they held no friendly communication with their neighbors and only left their own mountains to plunder and rob and so sullen and fierce were they on these occasions that every one took good care to keep out of their way until they had gone back home again  there was much gossip about the unknown king of spor who had never yet been seen by any one except his subjects and some thought he must be one of the huge giants of spor and others claimed he was a dwarf like his tiny but ferocious dart-slingers and still others imagined him one of the barbarian tribe or a fellow to the terrible gray men  but of course no one knew positively and all these guesses were very wide of the mark  the only certainty about this king was that his giants dwarfs barbarians and gray men meekly acknowledged his rule and obeyed his slightest wish for though they might be terrible to others their king was still more terrible to them  into this kingdom of spor prince marvel and nerle had now penetrated and neither knowing nor caring where they were continued along the faintly defined paths the horses had found  presently however they were startled by a peal of shrill elfish laughter and raising their eyes they beheld a horrid-looking old man seated upon a high rock near by  why do you laugh asked prince marvel stopping his horse  have you been invited  tell me have you been invited demanded the old man chuckling to himself as if much amused  invited where inquired the prince  to spor stupid  to the kingdom of spor  to the land of king terribus shrieked the old man going into violent peals of laughter  we go and come as we please answered prince marvel calmly  go yes  go if you will  but you'll never come back never never never the little old man seemed to consider this such a good joke that he bent nearly double with laughing and so lost his balance and toppled off the rock disappearing from their view but they could hear him laugh long after they had passed on and left him far behind them  a strange creature exclaimed the prince thoughtfully  but perhaps he speaks truth answered nerle if in fact we have been rash enough to enter the kingdom of spor  even my father the bravest baron in heg has never dared venture within the borders of spor  for all men fear its mysterious king  in that case replied prince marvel it is time some one investigated this strange kingdom  people have left king terribus and his wild subjects too much to themselves instead of stirring them up and making them behave themselves  nerle smiled at this speech  they are the fiercest people on the enchanted island said he and there are thousands upon thousands who obey this unknown king  but if you think we dare defy them i am willing to go on  perhaps our boldness will lead them into torturing me or starving me to death and at the very least i ought to find much trouble and privation in the kingdom of spor  time will determine that said the prince cheerfully  they had now ridden into a narrow defile of the mountains the pathway being lined with great fragments of rock  happening to look over his shoulder prince marvel saw that as they passed these rocks a man stepped from behind each fragment and followed after them their numbers thus constantly increasing until hundreds were silently treading in the wake of the travelers  these men were very peculiar in appearance their skins being as gray as the rocks themselves while their only clothing consisted of gray cloth tunics belted around the waists with bands of gray fox-hide they bore no weapons except that each was armed with a fork having three sharp tines six inches in length which the gray men carried stuck through their fox-hide belts  nerle also looked back and saw the silent throng following them and the sight sent such a cold shiver creeping up his spine that he smiled with pleasure  there was no way to avoid the gray men for the path was so narrow that the horsemen could not turn aside but prince marvel was not disturbed and seemed not to mind being followed so long as no one hindered his advance  he rode steadily on nerle following and after climbing upward for a long way the path began to descend presently leading them into a valley of wide extent in the center of which stood an immense castle with tall domes that glittered as if covered with pure gold  a broad roadway paved with white marble reached from the mountain pass to the entrance of this castle and on each side of this roadway stood lines of monstrous giants armed with huge axes thrust into their belts and thick oak clubs studded with silver spikes which were carried over their left shoulders  the assembled giants were as silent as the gray men and stood motionless while prince marvel and nerle rode slowly up the marble roadway  but all their brows were scowling terribly and their eyes were red and glaring as if they were balls of fire  i begin to feel very pleasant said nerle for surely we shall not get away from these folks without a vast deal of trouble  they do not seem to oppose our advance but it is plain they will not allow us any chance of retreat  we do not wish to retreat declared the prince  nerle cast another glance behind and saw that the gray men had halted at the edge of the valley while the giants were closing up as soon as the horses passed them and now marched in close file in their rear  it strikes me he muttered softly that this is like to prove our last adventure but although prince marvel might have heard the words he made no reply being evidently engaged in deep thought  as they drew nearer the castle it towered above them like a veritable mountain so big and high was it and the walls cast deep shadows far around as if twilight had fallen  they heard the loud blare of a trumpet sounding far up on the battlements the portals of the castle suddenly opened wide and they entered a vast courtyard paved with plates of gold  tiny dwarfs so crooked that they resembled crabs rushed forward and seized the bridles of the horses while the strangers slowly dismounted and looked around them  while the steeds were being led to the stables an old man clothed in a flowing robe as white in color as his beard bowed before prince marvel and said in a soft voice   follow me  the prince stretched his arms yawned as if tired with his ride and then glared upon the old man with an expression of haughty surprise  i follow no one said he proudly  i am prince marvel sirrah and if the owner of this castle wishes to see me i shall receive him here as befits my rank and station  the man looked surprised but only bowed lower than before  it is the king's command he answered  the king  yes you are in the castle of king terribus the lord and ruler of spor  that is different remarked the prince lightly  still i will follow no man  point out the way and i will go to meet his majesty  the old man extended a lean and trembling finger toward an archway prince marvel strode forward followed by nerle and passing under the arch he threw open a door at the far end and boldly entered the throne-room of king terribus    8  the fool-killer  the room was round with a dome at the top  the bare walls were of gray stone with square open windows set full twenty feet from the floor  rough gray stone also composed the floor and in the center of the room stood one great rock with a seat hollowed in its middle  this was the throne and round about it stood a swarm of men and women dressed in rich satins velvets and brocades brilliantly ornamented with gold and precious stones  the men were of many shapes and sizes giants and dwarfs being among them  the women all seemed young and beautiful  prince marvel cast but a passing glance at this assemblage for his eye quickly sought the rude throne on which was seated king terribus  the personal appearance of this monster was doubtless the most hideous known in that age of the world  his head was large and shaped like an egg it was bright scarlet in color and no hair whatever grew upon it it had three eyes one in the center of his face one on the top of his head and one in the back  thus he was always able to see in every direction at the same time  his nose was shaped like an elephant's trunk and swayed constantly from side to side  his mouth was very wide and had no lips at all two rows of sharp and white teeth being always plainly visible beneath the swaying nose  king terribus although surrounded by so splendid a court wore a simple robe of gray cloth with no ornament or other finery and his strange and fearful appearance was strongly contrasted with the glittering raiment of his courtiers and the beauty of his ladies in waiting  when prince marvel with nerle marching close behind entered the great room terribus looked at him sharply a moment and then bowed  and when he bowed the eye upon the top of his head also looked sharply at the intruders  then the king spoke his voice sounding so sweet and agreeable that it almost shocked nerle who had expected to hear a roar like that from a wild beast  why are you here asked terribus  partly by chance and partly from curiosity answered prince marvel no one in this island except your own people had ever seen the king of spor so finding myself in your country i decided to come here and have a look at you  the faces of the people who stood about the throne wore frightened looks at the unheard of boldness of this speech to their terrible monarch  but the king merely nodded and inquired   since you have seen me what do you think of me  i am sorry you asked that question returned the prince for i must confess you are a very frightful-looking creature and not at all agreeable to gaze upon  ha you are honest as well as frank exclaimed the king  but that is the reason i do not leave my kingdom as you will readily understand  and that is the reason i never permit strangers to come here under penalty of death  so long as no one knows the king of spor is a monster people will not gossip about my looks and i am very sensitive regarding my personal appearance  you will perhaps understand that if i could have chosen i should have been born beautiful instead of ugly  i certainly understand that  and permit me to say i wish you were beautiful  i shall probably dream of you for many nights added the prince  not for many said king terribus quietly  by coming here you have chosen death and the dead do not dream  why should i die inquired prince marvel curiously  because you have seen me  should i allow you to go away you would tell the world about my ugly face  i do not like to kill you believe me but you must pay the penalty of your rashness you and the man behind you  nerle smiled at this but whether from pride at being called a man or in pleasurable anticipation of the sufferings to come i leave you to guess  will you allow me to object to being killed asked the prince  certainly answered the king courteously  i expect you to object it is natural  but it will do you no good  then terribus turned to an attendant and commanded   send hither the fool-killer  at this prince marvel laughed outright  the fool-killer he cried surely your majesty does me little credit  am i then a fool  you entered my kingdom uninvited retorted the king and you tell me to my face i am ugly  moreover you laugh when i condemn you to death from this i conclude the fool-killer is the proper one to execute you behold  marvel turned quickly to find a tall stalwart man standing behind him  his features were strong but very grave and the prince caught a look of compassion in his eye as their gaze met  his skin was fair and without blemish a robe of silver cloth fell from his shoulders and in his right hand he bore a gleaming sword  well met cried marvel heartily as he bowed to the fool-killer  i have often heard your name mentioned but 'tis said in the world that you are a laggard in your duty  had i my way answered the fool-killer my blade would always drip it is my master yonder who thwarts my duty  and he nodded toward king terribus  then you should exercise your right on him and cleave the ugly head from his shoulders declared the prince  nay unless i interfered with the fool-killer said the king i should soon have no subjects left to rule for at one time or another they all deserve the blade  why that may be true enough replied prince marvel  but i think under such circumstances your fool-killer is a needless servant  so i will rid you of him in a few moments  with that he whipped out his sword and stood calmly confronting the fool-killer whose grave face never changed in expression as he advanced menacingly upon his intended victim  the blades clashed together and that of the fool-killer broke short off at the hilt  he took a step backward stumbled and fell prone upon the rocky floor while prince marvel sprang forward and pressed the point of his sword against his opponent's breast  hold cried the king starting to his feet  would you slay my fool-killer  think of the harm you would do the world  but he is laggard and unfaithful to his calling answered the prince sternly  nevertheless if he remove but one fool a year he is a benefit to mankind declared the king  release him i pray you  then the victor withdrew his sword and stood aside while the fool-killer slowly got upon his feet and bowed humbly before the king  go shouted terribus his eye flashing angrily  you have humiliated me before my enemy  as an atonement see that you kill me a fool a day for sixty days  hearing this command many of the people about the throne began to tremble but the king paid no attention to their fears and the fool-killer bowed again before his master and withdrew from the chamber    9  the royal dragon of spor  now said terribus regarding the prince gloomily i must dispose of you in another way  for a moment he dropped his scarlet head in thought  then he turned fiercely upon his attendants  let the wrestler come forward he shouted as loudly as his mild voice would carry  instantly a tall blackamoor advanced from the throng and cast off his flowing robe showing a strong figure clad only in a silver loincloth  crack me this fellow's bones commanded terribus  i beg your majesty will not compel me to touch him said prince marvel with a slight shudder for his skin is greasy and will soil my hands  here nerle he continued turning to his esquire dispose of this black man and save me the trouble  nerle laughed pleasantly  the black was a powerfully built man and compared with nerle and the prince who had but the stature of boys he towered like a very giant in size  nevertheless nerle did not hesitate to spring upon the wrestler who with a quick movement sent the boy crashing against the stone pavement  nerle was much bruised by the fall and as he painfully raised himself to his feet a great lump was swelling behind his left ear where his head had struck the floor and he was so dizzy that the room seemed swimming around him in a circle  but he gave a happy little laugh and said to the prince gratefully   thank you very much my master  the fall is hurting me delightfully i almost feel as if i could cry and that would be joy indeed  well answered the prince with a sigh i see i must get my hands greased after all for the black's body had really been greased to enable him to elude the grasp of his opponents  but marvel made a quick leap and seized the wrestler firmly around the waist  the next moment to the astonishment of all the black man flew swiftly into the air plunged through one of the open windows high up in the wall and disappeared from view  when the king and his people again turned their wondering eyes upon the prince he was wiping his hands carefully upon a silk handkerchief  at this sight a pretty young girl who stood near the throne laughed aloud and the sound of her laughter made king terribus very angry  come here he commanded sternly  the girl stepped forward her face now pale and frightened while tear-drops trembled upon the lashes that fringed her downcast eyes  you have dared to laugh at the humiliation of your king said terribus his horrid face more crimson than ever and as atonement i command that you drink of the poisoned cup  instantly a dwarf came near bearing a beautiful golden goblet in his crooked hands  drink he said an evil leer upon his face  the girl well knew this goblet contained a vile poison one drop of which on her tongue would cause death so she hesitated trembling and shrinking from the ordeal  prince marvel looked into her sweet face with pitying eyes and stepping quickly to her side took her hand in his  now drink he said smiling upon her the poison will not hurt you  she drank obediently while the dwarf chuckled with awful glee and the king looked on eagerly expecting her to fall dead at his feet  but instead the girl stood upright and pressed marvel's hand looking gratefully into his face  you are a fairy she whispered so low that no one else heard her voice  i knew that you would save me  keep my secret whispered the prince in return and still holding her hand he led her back to her former place  king terribus was almost wild with rage and disappointment and his elephant nose twisted and squirmed horribly  so you dare to thwart my commands do you he cried excitedly well we shall soon see which of us is the more powerful  i have decreed your death and die you shall  for a moment his eye roved around the chamber uncertainly  then he shouted suddenly   ho there  keepers of the royal menagerie appear  three men entered the room and bowed before the king  they were of the gray men of the mountains who had followed prince marvel and nerle through the rocky passes  bring hither the royal dragon cried the king and let him consume these strangers before my very eyes  the men withdrew and presently was heard a distant shouting followed by a low rumbling sound with groans snorts roars and a hissing like steam from the spout of a teakettle  the noise and shouting drew nearer while the people huddled together like frightened sheep and then suddenly the doors flew open and the royal dragon advanced to the center of the room  this creature was at once the pride and terror of the kingdom of spor it was more than thirty feet in length and covered everywhere with large green scales set with diamonds making the dragon when it moved a very glittering spectacle  its eyes were as big as pie-plates and its mouth when wide opened fully as large as a bath-tub  its tail was very long and ended in a golden ball such as you see on the top of flagstaffs  its legs which were as thick as those of an elephant had scales which were set with rubies and emeralds  it had two monstrous big ears and two horns of carved ivory and its teeth were also carved into various fantastic shapes such as castles horses' heads chinamen and griffins so that if any of them broke it would make an excellent umbrella handle  the royal dragon of spor came crawling into the throne-room rather clumsily groaning and moaning with every step and waving its ears like two blankets flying from a clothesline  the king looked on it and frowned  why are you not breathing fire and brimstone he demanded angrily  why i was caught out in a gale the other night returned the dragon rubbing the back of its ear with its left front paw as it paused and looked at the king and the wind put out my fire  then why didn't you light it again asked terribus turning on the keepers  we we were out of matches your majesty stammered the trembling gray men  so ho yelled the king and was about to order the keepers beheaded but just then nerle pulled out his match-box lit one of the matches and held it in front of the dragon's mouth  instantly the creature's breath caught fire and it began to breathe flames a yard in length  that's better sighed the dragon contentedly  i hope your majesty is now satisfied  no i am not satisfied declared king terribus  why do you not lash your tail  ah i can't do that replied the dragon  it's all stiffened up with rheumatism from the dampness of my cave  it hurts too much to lash it  well then gnash your teeth commanded the king  tut tut answered the dragon mildly i can't do that either for since you had them so beautifully carved it makes my teeth ache to gnash them  well then what are you good for cried the king in a fury  don't i look awful  am i not terrible to gaze on inquired the dragon proudly as it breathed out red and yellow flames and made them curl in circles around its horns  i guess there's no need for me to suggest terror to any one that happens to see me it added winking one of the pie-plate eyes at king terribus  the king looked at the monster critically and it really seemed to him that it was a frightful thing to behold  so he curbed his anger and said in his ordinary sweet voice   i have called you here to destroy these two strangers  how asked the dragon looking upon prince marvel and nerle with interest  i am not particular answered the king  you may consume them with your fiery breath or smash them with your tail or grind them to atoms between your teeth or tear them to pieces with your claws  only do hurry up and get it over with  hm-m-m said the dragon thoughtfully as if it didn't relish the job this one isn't saint george is it  no no exclaimed the king irritably it's prince marvel  do get to work as soon as possible  prince marvel prince marvel repeated the dragon  why there isn't a prince in the whole world named marvel  i'm pretty well posted on the history of royal families you know  i'm afraid he's saint george in disguise  isn't your name prince marvel inquired the king turning to the boyish-looking stranger  it is answered marvel  well it's mighty strange i've never heard of you persisted the dragon  but tell me please how would you prefer to be killed  oh i'm not going to be killed at all replied the prince laughing  do you hear that terribus asked the dragon turning to the king he says he isn't going to be killed  but i say he is cried terribus  i have decreed his death  but do you suppose i'm going to kill a man against his will inquired the dragon in a reproachful voice and such a small man too  do you take me for a common assassin or a murderer  do you intend to obey my orders roared the king  no i don't and that's flat returned the dragon sharply  it's time for me to take my cough medicine so if you've nothing more to say i'll go back to my cave  go go go shrieked the king stamping his foot in passion  you've outlived your usefulness  you're a coward  you're a traitor  you're a a a   i'm a dragon and a gentleman answered the monster proudly as the king paused for lack of a word and i believe i know what's proper for dragons to do and what isn't  i've learned wisdom from my father who got into trouble with saint george and if i fought with this person who calls himself prince marvel i'd deserve to be a victim of your fool-killer  oh i know my business king terribus and if you knew yours you'd get rid of this pretended prince as soon as possible  with this speech he winked at prince marvel turned soberly around and crawled from the room  one of the keepers got too near and the dragon's breath set fire to his robe the flames being with difficulty extinguished and the gold ball on the end of the dragon's tail struck a giant upon his shins and made him dance and howl in pain  but aside from these slight accidents the monster managed to leave the throne-room without undue confusion and every one including the king seemed glad to be rid of him    10  prince marvel wins his fight  when the door had closed on the royal dragon king terribus turned again to prince marvel while his crimson face glowed with embarrassment and his front eye rolled with baffled rage as he thought how vain had been all his efforts to kill this impudent invader of his domains  but his powers were by no means exhausted  he was a mighty king the mightiest of all in the enchanted island he believed and ways to destroy his enemies were numerous  send for a hundred of my gray men he suddenly cried and a courtier ran at once to summon them  the gray men would obey his orders without question he well knew  they were silent stubborn quick and faithful to their king  terribus had but to command and his will would be obeyed  they entered the room so quietly that nerle never knew they were there until he turned and found the hundred gray ones standing close together in the center of the hall  then prince marvel came to nerle's side and whispered something in his ear  will you obey my orders they heard the king ask  and the gray men with their eyes fixed upon their master nodded all their hundred heads and put their hands upon the dangerous three-tined forks that were stuck in every one of the hundred belts  prince marvel handed one end of a coiled rope to nerle and then they both sprang forward and ran around the spot where the hundred gray men stood huddled together  then they were pulled closer together than before closer and still closer for the prince and nerle had surrounded them with the rope and were tying the two ends together in a tight knot  the rope cut into the waists of those on the outside and they pressed inward against their fellows until there was scarcely space to stick a knife-blade between any two of them  when the prince had tied the rope firmly king terribus who had been looking on amazed saw that his hundred gray men were fastened together like a bundle of kindling-wood and were unable to stir hand or foot  and while he still gazed open-mouthed at the strange sight prince marvel tilted the bundle of men up on its edge and rolled it out of the door  it went rolling swiftly through the courtyard and bounded down the castle steps where the rope broke and the men fell sprawling in all directions on the marble walk  king terribus sighed for such treatment of his gray men whom he dearly loved made him very unhappy  but more than ever was he resolved to kill these impudent strangers who in the very heart of his kingdom where thousands bowed to his will dared openly defy his power  so after a moment's thought terribus beckoned to a dwarf who robed in gay and glittering apparel stood near his throne  summon the royal dart slingers he said with a scowl  the little man bowed and hastened away to return presently with twenty curiously crooked dwarfs each armed with a sling and a quiver full of slender sharp-pointed darts  slay me these strangers exclaimed the king in his gruffest voice  now nerle when he beheld these terrible dart slingers of whom he had heard many tales in his boyhood began to shiver and shake with fright so that his teeth rattled one upon another  and he reflected  soon shall i be content for these darts will doubtless pierce every part of my body  the dwarfs formed a line at one side of the gloomy throne-room and prince marvel who had been earnestly regarding them caught nerle by the arm and led him to the opposite wall  stand close behind me and you will be safe he whispered to his esquire  then each dwarf fixed a dart in his sling and at a word from their chief they all drew back their arms and launched a shower of the sharp missiles at the strangers  swift and true they sped each dart intended to pierce the body of the youthful knight who stood so calm before them  prince marvel had raised his right arm and in his hand was a small leather sack with a wide mouth  as the darts flew near him a strange thing happened  they each and all swerved from their true course and fell rattling into the leathern sack to the wonder of the royal slingers and the dismay of king terribus himself  again screamed the king his usually mild voice hoarse with anger  so again the dwarfs cast their darts and again the leathern sack caught them every one  another flight followed and yet another till the magic sack was packed full of the darts and not a dwarf had one remaining in his quiver  amid the awed silence of the beholders of this feat the merry laughter of prince marvel rang loud and clear for the sight of the puzzled and terrified faces about him was very comical  plucking a dart from the sack he raised his arm and cried   now it is my turn  you shall have back your darts  hold shouted the king in great fear  do not i beg you slay my faithful servants  and with a wave of his hand he dismissed the dwarfs who were glad to rush from the room and escape  nerle wiped the tears from his eyes for he was sorely disappointed at having again escaped all pain and discomfort but prince marvel seated himself quietly upon a stool and looked at the scowling face of king terribus with real amusement  the monarch of spor had never before been so foiled and scorned by any living creature  defeated and humbled before his own people he bowed his crimson head on his hands and sullenly regarded his foe with his top eye  then it was that the idea came to him that no ordinary mortal could have thwarted him so easily and he began to fear he was dealing perhaps unawares with some great magician or sorcerer  that a fairy should have assumed a mortal form he never once considered for such a thing was until then unheard of in the enchanted island of yew but with the knowledge that he had met his master whoever he might prove to be and that further attempts upon the stranger's life might lead to his own undoing king terribus decided to adopt a new line of conduct hoping to accomplish by stratagem what he could not do by force  to be sure there remained his regiment of giants the pride of his kingdom but terribus dreaded to meet with another defeat and he was not at all sure after what had happened that the giants would succeed in conquering or destroying the strangers  after all he thought my only object in killing them was to prevent their carrying news of my monstrous appearance to the outside world so if i can but manage to keep them forever in my kingdom it will answer my purpose equally well  as the result of this thought he presently raised his head and spoke to prince marvel in a quiet and even cheerful voice  enough of these rude and boisterous games said he with a smile that showed his white teeth in a repulsive manner  they may have seemed to my people an ill welcome to my good friend prince marvel yet they were only designed to show the powers of the mighty magician who has become my guest  nay do not deny it prince from the first i guessed your secret and to prove myself right i called my servants to oppose you being sure they could not do you an injury  but no more of such fooling and pray forgive my merry game at your expense  henceforth we shall be friends and you are heartily welcome to the best my kingdom affords  with this speech terribus stepped down from his throne and approached prince marvel with outstretched hand  the prince was not at all deceived but he was pleased to see how cunningly the king excused his attempts to kill him  so he laughed and touched the hand terribus extended for this fairy prince seemed to have no anger against any mortal who ventured to oppose him  the strangers were now conducted with every mark of respect to a beautiful suite of apartments in the castle wherein were soft beds with velvet spreads marble baths with perfumed waters and a variety of silken and brocaded costumes from which they might select a change of raiment  no sooner had they bathed and adorned themselves fittingly than they were summoned to the king's banquet hall being escorted thither by twelve young maidens bearing torches with lavender-colored flames  the night had fallen upon the mountains outside but the great banquet hall was brilliant with the glow of a thousand candles and seated at the head of the long table was king terribus  yet here as in the throne-room the ruler of spor was dressed in simplest garments and his seat was a rough block of stone  all about him were lords and ladies in gorgeous array the walls were hung with rare embroideries the table was weighted with gold platters and richly carved goblets filled with sweet nectars  but the king himself with his horrid ugly head was like a great blot on a fair parchment and even prince marvel could not repress a shudder as he gazed upon him  terribus placed his guest upon his right hand and loaded him with honors  nerle stood behind the prince's chair and served him faithfully as an esquire should  but the other servants treated nerle with much deference noting in him an air of breeding that marked him the unusual servant of an unusual master  indeed most curious were the looks cast on these marvelous men who had calmly walked into the castle of mighty terribus and successfully defied his anger for in spite of his youthful appearance and smiling face every attendant at the banquet feared prince marvel even more than they feared their own fierce king    11  the cunning of king terribus  the days that followed were pleasant ones for prince marvel and nerle who were treated as honored guests by both the king and his courtiers but the prince seemed to be the favorite for at all games of skill and trials at arms he was invariably the victor while in the evenings when the grand ball-room was lighted up and the musicians played sweet music none was so graceful in the dance as the fairy prince  nerle soon tired of the games and dancing for he had been accustomed to them at his father's castle and moreover he was shy in the society of ladies so before many weeks had passed he began to mope and show a discontented face  one day the prince noticed his esquire's dismal expression of countenance and asked the cause of it  why said nerle here i have left my home to seek worries and troubles and have found but the same humdrum life that existed at my father's castle  here our days are made smooth and pleasant and there is no excitement or grief whatever  you have become a carpet-knight prince marvel and think more of bright eyes than of daring deeds  so if you will release me from your service i will seek further adventures  nay returned the prince we will go together for i too am tired of this life of pleasure  so next morning marvel sought the presence of king terribus and said   i have come to bid your majesty adieu for my esquire and i are about to leave your dominions  at first the king laughed and his long nose began to sway from side to side  then seeing the prince was in earnest his majesty frowned and grew disturbed  finally he said   i must implore you to remain my guests a short time longer  no one has ever before visited me in my mountain home and i do not wish to lose the pleasure of your society so soon  nevertheless we must go answered the prince briefly  are you not contented asked terribus  ask whatever you may desire and it shall be granted you  we desire adventures amid new scenes said marvel and these you can not give us except by permission to depart  seeing his guest was obstinate the king ceased further argument and said   very well go if you wish  but i shall hope to see you return to us this evening  the prince paid no heed to this peculiar speech but left the hall and hurried to the courtyard of the castle where nerle was holding the horses in readiness for their journey  standing around were many rows and files of the gray men and when they reached the marble roadway they found it lined with motionless forms of the huge giants  but no one interfered with them in any way although both prince marvel and nerle knew that every eye followed them as they rode forward  curiously enough they had both forgotten from what direction they had approached the castle for whereas they had at that time noticed but one marble roadway leading to the entrance they now saw that there were several of these each one connecting with a path through the mountains  it really doesn't matter which way we go so long as we get away from the kingdom of spor said prince marvel so he selected a path by chance and soon they were riding through a mountain pass  the pleased expectant look on nerle's face had gradually turned to one of gloom  i hoped we should have a fight to get away he said sadly and in that case i might have suffered considerable injury and pain  but no one has injured us in any way and perhaps king terribus is really glad to be rid of us  with good reason too if such is the case laughed marvel for mark you nerle the king has discovered we are more powerful than he is and had he continued to oppose us we might have destroyed his entire army  on they rode through the rough hill paths winding this way and that until they lost all sense of the direction in which they were going  never mind said the prince so long as we get farther and farther away from the ugly terribus i shall be satisfied  perhaps we are getting into more serious danger than ever answered nerle brightening one of the giants told me the other day that near the foot of these mountains is the kingdom of the high ki of twi  who is the high ki of twi asked prince marvel  no one knows answered nerle  and what is the kingdom of twi like  no one knows that answered nerle  then returned the prince with a smile if by chance we visit the place we shall know more than any one else  at noon they ate luncheon by the wayside nerle having filled his pouch by stealth at the breakfast table  there were great fragments of rock lying all about them and the sun beat down so fiercely that the heat reflected from the rocks was hard to bear  so the travelers did not linger over their meal but remounted and rode away as soon as possible  when the sun began to get lower in the sky the rocks beside the path threw the riders into shadow so that their journey became more pleasant  they rode along paying little attention to the way but talking and laughing merrily together until it began to grow dark  does this path never end asked prince marvel suddenly  we ought to reach some place where men dwell before long else we shall be obliged to spend the night among these rocks  and then perhaps the wolves will attack us said nerle cheerfully and tear us into pieces with their sharp teeth and claws  but even as he spoke they rode around a turn in the path and saw a sight that made them pause in astonishment  for just before them rose the castle of king terribus and along both sides of the marble walk leading up to it were ranged the lines of giants exactly as they had stood in the morning  nerle turned around in his saddle  sure enough there were the gray men in the rear stepping from behind every boulder and completely filling the rocky pathway  well what shall we do asked the esquire fight  no indeed returned prince marvel laughing at his friend's eager face  it appears the path we chose winds around in a circle and so has brought us back to our starting-point  so we must make the best of a bad blunder and spend another night with our ugly friend king terribus  they rode forward through the rows of giants to the castle where the ever-courteous servants took their horses and escorted them to their former handsome apartments with every mark of respect  no one seemed in the least surprised at their speedy return and this fact at first puzzled nerle and then made him suspicious  after bathing and dusting their clothing they descended to the banquet hall where king terribus sat upon his gray stone throne and welcomed them with quiet courtesy  the sight of the king's crimson skin and deformed face sent a thrill of repugnance through prince marvel and under the impulse of a sudden thought he extended his hand toward terribus and whispered a magic word which was unheard by any around him  nerle did not notice the prince's swift gesture nor the whispered word but he was staring straight at terribus at the time and he saw with surprise the eye on the top of the king's head move down toward his forehead and the eye in the center of his forehead slide slightly toward the left and the elephant-like nose shrink and shorten at the same time  also it seemed to him that the king's skin was not so crimson in color as before and that a thin growth of hair had covered his head  however no one else appeared to notice any change least of all terribus so nerle seated himself at the table and began to eat  it was very kind of you to return so soon to my poor castle said the king to prince marvel in his sweet voice  we could not help it laughed the prince in reply for the road wound right and left until we knew not which way we traveled and then it finally circled around again to your castle  but to-morrow we shall seek a new path and bid you farewell forever  still remarked the king gravely should you again miss your way i shall be glad to welcome your return  the prince bowed politely by way of reply and turned to address the little maiden he had once saved from death by poison  and so in feasting dancing and laughter the evening passed pleasantly enough to the prince and it was late when he called nerle to attend him to their apartment    12  the gift of beauty  the following morning marvel and nerle once more set out to leave the kingdom of spor and its ugly king  they selected another pathway leading from the castle and traveled all day coming at nightfall into view of the place whence they had started with its solemn rows of giants and gray men standing ready to receive them  this repetition of their former experience somewhat annoyed the prince while nerle's usually despondent face wore a smile  i see trouble ahead murmured the esquire almost cheerfully  since the king can not conquer us by force he intends to do it by sorcery  marvel did not reply but greeted the king quietly while terribus welcomed their return as calmly as if he well knew they could not escape him  that evening the prince made another pass toward the king with his hand and muttered again the magic word  nerle was watching and saw the upper eye of terribus glide still farther down his forehead and the other eye move again toward the left  the swaying nose shrank to a few inches in length and the skin that had once been so brilliantly crimson turned to a dull red color  this time the courtiers and ladies in waiting also noticed the change in the king's features but were afraid to speak of it as any reference to their monarch's personal appearance was by law punishable by death  terribus saw the startled looks directed upon him and raised his hand to feel of his nose and eyes but thinking that if any change in his appearance had taken place he must be uglier than before he only frowned and turned away his head  the next day the king's guests made a third attempt to leave his dominions but met with no better success than before for a long and tedious ride only brought them back to their starting-place in the evening  this time prince marvel was really angry and striding into the king's presence he reproached him bitterly saying   why do you prevent us from leaving your kingdom  we have not injured you in any way  you have seen me returned terribus calmly and i do not intend you shall go back to the world and tell people how ugly i am  the prince looked at him and could not repress a smile  the two eyes of the king having been twice removed from their first position were now both in his forehead instead of below it and one was much higher than the other  and the nose although small when compared to what it had been still resembled an elephant's trunk  other changes had been made for the better but terribus was still exceedingly repulsive to look upon  seeing the prince look at him and smile the king flew into a fury of anger and declared that the strangers should never while they lived be permitted to leave his castle again  prince marvel became thoughtful at this reflecting that the king's enmity all arose from his sensitiveness about his ugly appearance and this filled the youthful knight with pity rather than resentment  when they had all assembled at the evening banquet the prince for a third time made a mystic pass at the king and whispered a magic word and behold this time the charm was complete  for the two front eyes of terribus fell into their proper places his nose became straight and well formed and his skin took on a natural healthy color  moreover he now had a fine head of soft brown hair with eyebrows and eyelashes to match and his head was shapely and in proportion to his body  as for the eye that had formerly been in the back of his head it had disappeared completely  so amazed were the subjects of the transformed king who was now quite handsome to look upon that they began to murmur together excitedly and something in the new sensations he experienced gave to the king's face likewise an expression of surprise  knowing from their pleased looks that he must have improved in appearance he found courage to raise his hand to his nose and found it well formed  then he touched his eyes and realized they were looking straight out from his face like those of other people  for some moments after making these discoveries the king remained motionless a smile of joy gradually spreading over his features  then he said aloud   what has happened  why do you all look so startled  your majesty is no longer ugly replied marvel laughingly so that when nerle and i leave your kingdom we can proclaim nothing less than praise of your dignified and handsome appearance  is my face indeed pleasing demanded the king eagerly  it is cried the assembled courtiers and ladies as with one voice  bring me a mirror said the king  i shall look at my reflection for the first time in many years  the mirror being brought king terribus regarded himself for a long time with pleased astonishment and then his sensitive nature being overcome by the shock of his good fortune he burst into a flood of tears and rushed from the room  the courtiers and ladies now bestowed many grateful thanks upon prince marvel for his kind deed for they realized that thereafter their lives would be safer from the king's anger and much pleasanter in every way  terribus is not bad by nature said one but he brooded upon his ugliness so much that the least thing served to throw him into a violent passion and our lives were never safe from one day to another  by and by two giants entered the hall and carried away the throne of gray stone where terribus had been accustomed to sit and other slaves brought a gorgeous throne of gold studded with precious jewels which they put in its place  and after a time the king himself returned to the room his simple gray gown replaced by flowing robes of purple with rich embroideries such as he had not worn for many years  my people said he addressing those present with kindness and dignity it seems to me fitting that a handsome king should be handsomely attired and an ugly one clothed simply  for years i have been so terrible in feature that i dared not even look at my own image in a mirror  but now thanks to the gracious magic of my guest i have become like other men and hereafter you will find my rule as kind as it was formerly cruel  to-night in honor of this joyous occasion we shall feast and make merry and it is my royal command that you all do honor and reverence to the illustrious prince marvel  a loud shout of approval greeted this speech and the evening was merry indeed  terribus joined freely in the revelry laughing as gaily as the lightest-hearted damsel present  it was nearly morning before they all retired and as they sought their beds nerle asked the prince in a voice that sounded like an ill-natured growl   why did you give the king beauty after his treatment of us  marvel looked at the reproachful face of his esquire and smiled  when you are older said he you will find that often there are many ways to accomplish a single purpose  the king's ugliness was the bar to our leaving his country for he feared our gossip  so the easiest way for us to compass our escape was to take away his reason for detaining us thus i conquered the king in my own way and at the same time gained his gratitude and friendship  will he allow us to depart in the morning inquired nerle  i think so said marvel  it was late when they rose from their slumbers but having breakfasted the prince's first act was to seek the king  we wish to leave your kingdom said he  will you let us go  terribus grasped the hand of his guest and pressed it with fervor while tears of gratitude stood in his eyes  i should prefer that you remain with me always and be my friend he answered  but if you choose to leave me i shall not interfere in any way with your wishes  prince marvel looked at him thoughtfully and then said  my time on this island is short  in a few months prince marvel will have passed out of the knowledge of men and his name will be forgotten  before then i hope to visit the kingdoms of dawna and auriel and plenta so i must not delay but beg you will permit me to depart at once  very well answered terribus  come with me and i shall show you the way  he led the prince and nerle to a high wall of rock and placing his hand upon its rough surface touched a hidden spring  instantly an immense block of stone began to swing backward disclosing a passage large enough for a man on horseback to ride through  this is the one road that leads out of my kingdom said terribus the others all begin and end at the castle  so that unless you know the secret of this passage you could never escape from spor  but where does this road lead asked marvel  to the kingdom of auriel which you desire to visit  it is not a straight road for it winds around the land of twi so it will carry you a little out of your way  what is the land of twi inquired the prince  a small country hidden from the view of all travelers said terribus no one has ever yet found a way to enter the land of twi yet there is a rumor that it is ruled by a mighty personage called the high ki  and does the rumor state what the high ki of twi is like  no indeed returned the king smiling so it will do you no good to be curious  and now farewell and may good luck attend you  yet bear in mind the fact that king terribus of spor owes you a mighty debt of gratitude and if you ever need my services you have but to call on me and i shall gladly come to your assistance  i thank you said marvel but there is small chance of my needing help  farewell and may your future life be pleasant and happy  with this he sprang to the saddle of his prancing charger and followed by nerle rode slowly through the stone arch  the courtiers and ladies had flocked from the palace to witness their departure and the giants and dwarfs and gray men were drawn up in long lines to speed the king's guests  so it was a brilliant sight that marvel and nerle looked back on but once they were clear of the arch the great stone rolled back into its place shutting them out completely from the kingdom of spor with its turreted castle and transformed king    13  the hidden kingdom of twi  knowing that at last they were free to roam according to their desire the travelers rode gaily along the paths taking but scant heed of their way  our faces are set toward new adventures remarked the prince  let us hope they will prove more pleasant than the last  to be sure responded nerle  let us hope at any rate that we shall suffer more privations and encounter more trouble than we did in that mountainous kingdom of spor  then he added  for one reason i regret you are my master  what is that reason asked the prince turning to smile upon his esquire  you have a way of overcoming all difficulties without any trouble whatsoever and that deprives me of any chance of coming to harm while in your company  cheer up my boy cried marvel  did i not say there are new adventures before us  we may not come through them so easily as we came through the others  that is true replied nerle it is always best to hope and then he inquired  why do you stop here in the middle of the path  because the path has ended rather suddenly answered marvel  here is a thick hedge of prickly briers barring our way  nerle looked over his master's shoulder and saw that a great hedge high and exceedingly thick cut off all prospect of their advancing  this is pleasant said he but i might try to force our way through the hedge  the briers would probably prick me severely and that would be delightful  try it the prince returned with twinkling eyes  nerle sprang from his horse to obey but at the first contact with the briers he uttered a howl of pain and held up his hands which were bleeding in a dozen places from the wounds of the thorns  ah that will content you for a time i trust said marvel  now follow me and we will ride along beside the hedge until we find an opening  for either it will come to an end or there will prove to be a way through it to the other side  so they rode alongside the hedge for hour after hour yet it did not end nor could they espy any way to get through the thickly matted briers  by and by night fell and they tethered their horses to some shrubs where there were a few scanty blades of grass for them to crop and then laid themselves down upon the ground with bare rocks for pillows where they managed to sleep soundly until morning  they had brought a supply of food in their pouches and on this they breakfasted afterward continuing their journey beside the hedge  at noon prince marvel uttered an exclamation of surprise and stopped his horse  what is it asked nerle  i have found the handkerchief with which you wiped the blood from your hands yesterday morning and then carelessly dropped replied the prince  this proves that we have made a complete circle around this hedge without finding a way to pass through it  in that case said nerle we had better leave the hedge and go in another direction  not so declared marvel  the hedge incloses some unknown country and i am curious to find out what it is  but there is no opening remonstrated nerle  then we must make one  wouldn't you like to enjoy a little more pain  thank you answered nerle my hands are still smarting very comfortably from the pricks of yesterday  therefore i must make the attempt myself said the prince and drawing his sword he whispered a queer word to it and straightway began slashing at the hedge  the brambles fell fast before his blade and when he had cut a big heap of branches from the hedge nerle dragged them to one side and the prince began again  it was marvelous how thick the hedge proved  only a magic sword could have done this work and remained sharp and only a fairy arm could have proved strong enough to hew through the tough wood  but the magic sword and fairy arm were at work and naught could resist them  after a time the last branches were severed and dragged from the path and then the travelers rode their horses through the gap into the unknown country beyond  they saw at first glance that it was a land of great beauty but after that one look both prince marvel and nerle paused and rubbed their eyes to assure themselves that their vision was not blurred  before them were two trees exactly alike  and underneath the trees two cows were grazing each a perfect likeness of the other  at their left were two cottages with every door and window and chimney the exact counterpart of another  before these houses two little boys were playing evidently twins for they not only looked alike and dressed alike but every motion one made was also made by the other at the same time and in precisely the same way  when one laughed the other laughed and when one stubbed his toe and fell down the other did likewise and then they both sat up and cried lustily at the same time  at this two women it was impossible to tell one from the other rushed out of the two houses caught up the two boys shook and dusted them in precisely the same way and led them by their ears back into the houses  again the astonished travelers rubbed their eyes and then prince marvel looked at nerle and said   i thought at first that i saw everything double but there seems to be only one of you  and of you answered the boy  but see there are two hills ahead of us and two paths lead from the houses over the hills  how strange it all is  just then two birds flew by close together and perfect mates and the cows raised their heads and mooed at the same time and two men also twins came over the two hills along the two paths with two dinner-pails in their hands and entered the two houses  they were met at the doors by the two women who kissed them exactly at the same time and helped them off with their coats with the same motions and closed the two doors with two slams at the same instant  nerle laughed  what sort of country have we got into he asked  let us find out replied the prince and riding up to one of the houses he knocked on the door with the hilt of his sword  instantly the doors of both houses flew open and both men appeared in the doorways  both started back in amazement at sight of the strangers and both women shrieked and both little boys began to cry both mothers boxed the children's ears and both men gasped out   who who are you  their voices were exactly alike and their words were spoken in unison prince marvel replied courteously   we are two strangers who have strayed into your country  but i do not understand why our appearance should so terrify you  why you are singular  there is only half of each of you exclaimed the two men together  not so said the prince trying hard not to laugh in their faces we may be single while you appear to be double but each of us is perfect nevertheless  perfect  and only half of you cried the men  and again the two women who were looking over their husbands' shoulders screamed at sight of the strangers and again the two boys who were clinging to their mothers' dresses in the same positions began to cry  we did not know such strange people existed said the two men both staring at the strangers and then wiping the beads of perspiration from their two brows with two faded yellow handkerchiefs  nor did we retorted the prince  i assure you we are as much surprised as you are  nerle laughed again at this and to hear only one of the strangers speak and the other only laugh seemed to terrify the double people anew  so prince marvel quickly asked   please tell us what country this is  the land of twi answered both men together  oh the land of twi  and why is the light here so dim continued the prince  dim repeated the men as if surprised why this is twilight of course  of course said nerle  i hadn't thought of that  we are in the long hidden land of twi which all men have heard of but no man has found before  and who may you be questioned the prince looking from one man to the other curiously  we are twis they answered  twice  twis inhabitants of twi  it's the same thing laughed nerle  you see everything twice in this land  are none of your people single asked prince marvel  single returned the men as if perplexed  we don't understand  are you all double or are some of you just one said the prince who found it difficult to put his question plainly  what does 'one' mean asked the men  there is no such word as 'one' in our language  they have no need of such a word declared nerle  we are only poor laborers explained the men  but over the hills lie the cities of twi where the ki and the ki-ki dwell and also the high ki  ah said marvel i've heard of your high ki  who is he  the men shook their heads together and with the same motion  we have never seen the glorious high ki they answered  the sight of their faces is forbidden  none but the ki and the ki-ki has seen the supreme rulers and high ki  i'm getting mixed said nerle  all this about the ki and the ki-ki and the high ki makes me dizzy  let's go on to the city and explore it  that is a good suggestion replied the prince  good by my friends he added addressing the men  they both bowed and although they still seemed somewhat frightened they answered him civilly and in the same words and closed their doors at the same time  so prince marvel and nerle rode up the double path to the hills and the two cows became frightened and ran away with the same swinging step keeping an exact space apart  and when they were a safe distance they both stopped looked over their right shoulders and mooed at the same instant    14  the ki and the ki-ki  from the tops of the hills the travelers caught their first glimpse of the wonderful cities of twi  two walls surrounded the cities and in the walls were two gates just alike  within the inclosures stood many houses but all were built in pairs from the poorest huts to the most splendid palaces  every street was double the pavements running side by side  there were two lamp-posts on every corner and in the dim twilight that existed these lamp-posts were quite necessary  if there were trees or bushes anywhere they invariably grew in pairs and if a branch was broken on one it was sure to be broken on the other and dead leaves fell from both trees at identically the same moment  much of this marvel and nerle learned after they had entered the cities but the view from the hills showed plainly enough that the double plan existed everywhere and in every way in this strange land  they followed the paths down to the gates of the walls where two pairs of soldiers rushed out and seized their horses by the bridles  these soldiers all seemed to be twins or at least mates and each one of each pair was as like the other as are two peas growing in the same pod  if one had a red nose the other's was red in the same degree and the soldiers that held the bridles of nerle's horse both had their left eyes bruised and blackened as from a blow of the same force  these soldiers as they looked upon nerle and the prince seemed fully as much astonished and certainly more frightened than their prisoners they were dressed in bright yellow uniforms with green buttons and the soldiers who had arrested the prince had both torn their left coat-sleeves and had patches of the same shape upon the seats of their trousers  how dare you stop us fellows asked the prince sternly  the soldiers holding his horse both turned and looked inquiringly at the soldiers holding nerle's horse and these turned to look at a double captain who came out of two doors in the wall and walked up to them  such things were never before heard of said the two captains their startled eyes fixed upon the prisoners  we must take them to the ki and the ki-ki  why so asked prince marvel  because replied the officers they are our rulers under grace of the high ki and all unusual happenings must be brought to their notice  it is our law you know the law of the kingdom of twi  very well said marvel quietly take us where you will but if any harm is intended us you will be made to regret it  the ki and the ki-ki will decide returned the captains gravely their words sounding at the same instant  and then the two pairs of soldiers led the horses through the double streets the captains marching ahead with drawn swords and crowds of twin men and twin women coming from the double doors of the double houses to gaze upon the strange sight of men and horses who were not double  presently they came upon a twin palace with twin turrets rising high into the air and before the twin doors the prisoners dismounted marvel was escorted through one door and nerle through another and then they saw each other going down a double hallway to a room with a double entrance  passing through this they found themselves in a large hall with two domes set side by side in the roof  the domes were formed of stained glass and the walls of the hall were ornamented by pictures in pairs each pair showing identically the same scenes  this was of course reasonable enough in such a land where two people would always look at two pictures at the same time and admire them in the same way with the same thoughts  beneath one of the domes stood a double throne on which sat the ki of twi a pair of gray-bearded and bald-headed men who were lean and lank and stoop-shouldered  they had small eyes black and flashing long hooked noses great pointed ears and they were smoking two pipes from which the smoke curled in exactly the same circles and clouds  beneath the other dome sat the ki-ki of twi also on double thrones similar to those of the ki  the ki-ki were two young men and had golden hair combed over their brows and banged straight across and their eyes were blue and mild in expression and their cheeks pink and soft  the ki-ki were playing softly upon a pair of musical instruments that resembled mandolins and they were evidently trying to learn a new piece of music for when one ki-ki struck a false note the other ki-ki struck the same false note at the same time and the same expression of annoyance came over the two faces at the same moment  when the prisoners entered the pairs of captains and soldiers bowed low to the two pairs of rulers and the ki exclaimed both in the same voice of surprise   great kika-koo what have we here  most wonderful prisoners your highnesses answered the captains we found them at your cities' gates and brought them to you at once they are as your highnesses will see each singular and but half of what he should be  'tis so cried the double ki in loud voices and slapping their right thighs with their right palms at the same time  most remarkable  most remarkable  i don't see anything remarkable about it returned prince marvel calmly  it is you who are not singular but double that seem strange and outlandish  perhaps perhaps said the two old men thoughtfully  it is what we are not accustomed to that seems to us remarkable  eh ki-ki they added turning to the other rulers  the ki-ki who had not spoken a word but continued to play softly simply nodded their blond heads carelessly so the ki looked again at the prisoners and asked   how did you get here  we cut a hole through the prickly hedge replied prince marvel  a hole through the hedge  great kika-koo cried the gray-bearded ki is there then anything or any place on the other side of the hedge  why of course  the world is there returned the prince laughing  the old men looked puzzled and glanced sharply from their little black eyes at their prisoners  we thought nothing existed outside the hedge of twi they answered simply  but your presence here proves we were wrong  eh ki-ki  this last was again directed toward the pair of musicians who continued to play and only nodded quietly as before  now that you are here said the twin ki stroking their two gray beards with their two left hands in a nervous way it must be evident to you that you do not belong here  therefore you must go back through the hedge again and stay on the other side  eh ki-ki  the ki-ki still continued playing but now spoke the first words the prisoners had heard from them  they must die said the ki-ki in soft and agreeable voices  die echoed the twin ki die  great kika-koo  and why so  because if there is a world on the other side of the hedge they would tell on their return all about the land of twi and others of their kind would come through the hedge from curiosity and annoy us we can not be annoyed  we are busy  having delivered this speech both the ki-ki went on playing the new tune as if the matter was settled  nonsense retorted the old ki angrily  you are getting more and more bloodthirsty every day our sweet and gentle ki-ki  but we are the ki and we say the prisoners shall not die  we say they shall answered the youthful ki-ki nodding their two heads at the same time with a positive motion  you may be the ki but we are the ki-ki and your superior  not in this case declared the old men  where life and death are concerned we have equal powers with you  and if we disagree asked the players gently  great kika-koo  if we disagree the high ki must judge between us roared the twin ki excitedly  quite so answered the ki-ki  the strangers shall die  they shall not die stormed the old men with fierce gestures toward the others while both pairs of black eyes flashed angrily  then we disagree and they must be taken to the high ki returned the blond musicians beginning to play another tune  the two ki rose from their thrones paced two steps to the right and three steps to the left and then sat down again  very well they said to the captains who had listened unmoved to the quarrel of the rulers keep these half-men safe prisoners until to-morrow morning and then the ki-ki and we ourselves will conduct them to the mighty high ki  at this command the twin captains bowed again to both pairs of rulers and led prince marvel and nerle from the room  then they were escorted along the streets to the twin houses of the captains and here the officers paused and scratched their left ears with uncertain gestures  there being only half of each of you they said we do not know how to lock each of you in double rooms  oh let us both occupy the same room said prince marvel  we prefer it  very well answered the captains we must transgress our usual customs in any event so you may as well be lodged as you wish  so nerle and the prince were thrust into a large and pleasant room of one of the twin houses the double doors were locked upon them by twin soldiers and they were left to their own thoughts    15  the high ki of twi  tell me prince are we awake or asleep asked nerle as soon as they were alone  there is no question of our being awake replied the prince with a laugh  but what a curious country it is and what a funny people  we can't call them odd or singular said the esquire for everything is even in numbers and double in appearance  it makes me giddy to look at them and i keep feeling of myself to make sure there is still only one of me  you are but half a boy laughed the prince at least so long as you remain in the land of twi  i'd like to get out of it in double-quick time answered nerle and we should even now be on the other side of the hedge were it not for that wicked pair of ki-ki who are determined to kill us  it is strange said the prince thoughtfully that the fierce-looking old ki should be our friends and the gentle ki-ki our enemies  how little one can tell from appearances what sort of heart beats in a person's body  before nerle could answer the two doors opened and two pairs of soldiers entered  they drew two small tables before the prince and two before nerle and then other pairs of twin soldiers came and spread cloths on the tables and set twin platters of meat and bread and fruit on each of the tables  when the meal had been arranged the prisoners saw that there was enough for four people instead of two and the soldiers realized this also for they turned puzzled looks first on the tables and then on the prisoners  then they shook all their twin heads gravely and went away locking the twin doors behind them  we have one advantage in being singular said nerle cheerfully and that is we are not likely to starve to death  for we can eat the portions of our missing twins as well as our own  i should think you would enjoy starving remarked the prince  no i believe i have more exquisite suffering in store for me since i have met that gentle pair of ki-ki said nerle  while they were eating the two captains came in and sat down in two chairs  these captains seemed friendly fellows and after watching the strangers for a while they remarked   we are glad to see you able to eat so heartily for to-morrow you will probably die  that is by no means certain replied marvel cutting a piece from one of the twin birds on a platter before him to the extreme surprise of the captains who had always before seen both birds carved alike at the same time  your gray-bearded old ki say we shall not die  true answered the captains  but the ki-ki have declared you shall  their powers seem to be equal said nerle and we are to be taken before the high ki for judgment  therein lies your danger returned the captains speaking in the same tones and with the same accents on their words  for it is well known the ki-ki has more influence with the high ki than the ki has  hold on cried nerle you are making me dizzy again  i can't keep track of all these kis  what is the high ki like asked prince marvel who was much interested in the conversation of the captains  but this question the officers seemed unable to answer  they shook their heads slowly and said   the high ki are not visible to the people of twi  only in cases of the greatest importance are the high ki ever bothered or even approached by the ki and the ki-ki who are supposed to rule the land according to their own judgment  but if they chance to disagree then the matter is carried before the high ki who live in a palace surrounded by high walls in which there are no gates  only these rulers have ever seen the other side of the walls or know what the high ki are like  that is strange said the prince  but we ourselves it seems are to see the high ki to-morrow and whoever they may chance to be we hope to remain alive after the interview  that is a vain hope answered the captains for it is well known that the high ki usually decide in favor of the ki-ki and against the wishes of the old ki  that is certainly encouraging said nerle  when the captains had gone and left them to themselves the esquire confided to his master his expectations in the following speech   this high ki sounds something terrible and fierce in my ears and as they are doubtless a pair they will be twice terrible and fierce perhaps his royal doublets will torture me most exquisitely before putting me to death and then i shall feel that i have not lived in vain  they slept in comfortable beds that night although an empty twin bed stood beside each one they occupied  and in the morning they were served another excellent meal after which the captains escorted them again to the twin palaces of the ki and the ki-ki  there the two pairs of rulers met them and headed the long procession of soldiers toward the palace of the high ki  first came a band of music in which many queer sorts of instruments were played in pairs by twin musicians and it was amusing to nerle to see the twin drummers roll their twin drums exactly at the same time and the twin trumpets peal out twin notes  after the band marched the double ki-ki and the double ki their four bodies side by side in a straight line  the ki-ki had left their musical instruments in the palace and now wore yellow gloves with green stitching down the backs and swung gold-headed canes jauntily as they walked  the ki stooped their aged shoulders and shuffled along with their hands in their pockets and only once did they speak and that was to roar great kika-koo when the ki-ki jabbed their canes down on the ki's toes  following the ki-ki and the ki came the prince and nerle escorted by the twin captains and then there were files of twin soldiers bringing up the rear  crowds of twin people with many twin children amongst them turned out to watch the unusual display and many pairs of twin dogs barked together in unison and snapped at the heels of the marching twin soldiers  by and by they reached the great wall surrounding the high ki's palace and sure enough there was never a gate in the wall by which any might enter  but when the ki and the ki-ki had blown a shrill signal upon two pairs of whistles they all beheld two flights of silver steps begin to descend from the top of the wall and these came nearer and nearer the ground until at last they rested at the feet of the ki then the old men began ascending the steps carefully and slowly and the captains motioned to the prisoners to follow  so prince marvel followed one of the ki up the steps and nerle the other ki while the two ki-ki came behind them so they could not escape  so to the top of the wall they climbed where a pair of twin servants in yellow and green which seemed to be the royal colors welcomed them and drew up the pair of silver steps afterward letting them down on the other side of the wall side by side  they descended in the same order as they had mounted to the top of the wall and now prince marvel and nerle found themselves in a most beautiful garden filled with twin beds of twin flowers with many pairs of rare shrubs  also there were several double statuettes on pedestals and double fountains sending exactly the same sprays of water the same distance into the air  double walks ran in every direction through the garden and in the center of the inclosure stood a magnificent twin palace built of blocks of white marble exquisitely carved  the ki and the ki-ki at once led their prisoners toward the palace and entered at its large arched double doors where several pairs of servants met them  these servants they found were all dumb so that should they escape from the palace walls they could tell no tales of the high ki  the prisoners now proceeded through several pairs of halls winding this way and that and at last came to a pair of golden double doors leading into the throne-room of the mighty high ki  here they all paused and the ki-ki both turned to the prince and nerle and said   you are the only persons excepting ourselves and the palace servants who have ever been permitted to see the high ki of twi  as you are about to die that does not matter but should you by any chance be permitted to live you must never breathe a word of what you are about to see under penalty of a sure and horrible death  the prisoners made no reply to this speech and after the two ki-ki had given them another mild look from their gentle blue eyes these officials clapped their twin hands together and the doors of gold flew open  a perfect silence greeted them during which the double ki and the double ki-ki bent their four bodies low and advanced into the throne-room followed by prince marvel and nerle  in the center of the room stood two thrones of dainty filigree work in solid gold and over them were canopies of yellow velvet the folds of which were caught up and draped with bands of green ribbon  and on the thrones were seated two of the sweetest and fairest little maidens that mortal man had ever beheld  their lovely hair was fine as a spider's web their eyes were kind and smiling their cheeks soft and dimpled their mouths shapely as a cupid's bow and tinted like the petals of a rose  upon their heads were set two crowns of fine spun gold worked into fantastic shapes and set with glittering gems  their robes were soft silks of pale yellow with strings of sparkling emeralds for ornament  anything so lovely and fascinating as these little maids who were precisely alike in every particular neither prince marvel nor nerle had ever dreamed could exist  they stood for a time spellbound and filled with admiration while the two pairs of rulers bowed again and again before the dainty and lovable persons of their high ki  but it was hard for nerle to keep quiet for long and presently he exclaimed in a voice loud enough to be heard by all present   by the great kika-koo of our friends the ki these darling high ki of twi are sweet enough to be kissed    16  the rebellion of the high ki  the bold speech of nerle's made the two damsels laugh at the same time and their sweet laughter sounded like rippling strains of harmonious music  but the two ki-ki frowned angrily and the two ki looked at the boy in surprise as if wondering at his temerity  who are these strangers asked the pretty high ki speaking together as all the twins of twi did and why are they not mates but only half of each other  these questions your supreme highnesses said the blond-haired pair of ki-ki we are unable to answer  perhaps then the strangers can answer themselves said the little maids smiling first upon the ki-ki and then upon the prisoners  prince marvel bowed  i am from the great outside world said he and my name is prince marvel  until now i have never seen people that live in pairs and speak in unison and act in the same way and think the same thoughts my world is much bigger than your world and in it every person is proud to think and act for himself  you say i am only a 'half' but that is not so  i am perfect without a counterpart my friend nerle is perfect without a counterpart and it is yourselves who are halved for in the land of twi no person is complete or perfect without its other half and it seems to take two of you to make one man or one maid  the sweet faces of the twin high ki grew thoughtful at this speech and they said   indeed it may be you are right  but it is our custom in twi to do everything double and to live double then turning to the ki they asked  why have you brought these strangers here  to ask your supreme highnesses to permit them to return again to the world from whence they came answered the ki both of them regarding their supreme rulers earnestly  but here the ki-ki spoke up quickly in their mild voices saying   that is not our idea your highnesses  we the ki-ki of twi think it best the strangers should be put to death  and we pray your supreme highnesses to favor our wish  the two little maids looked from the ki to the ki-ki and frowned and pouted their rosy lips in evident perplexity  but nerle whispered to prince marvel   it's all up with us  i know very well why her royal doublets always favors the ki-ki  it's because they are young and handsome while the ki are old and ugly  both of her will condemn us to death you see if she don't  this seemed somewhat mixed but nerle was in earnest and prince marvel who had not forgotten his fairy lore began to weave a silent spell over the head of the nearest twin high ki  but just as it was completed and before he had time to work the spell on the other twin the ki-ki grew impatient and exclaimed   we beg your highnesses not to keep us waiting  let us have your decision at once  and the twin maidens raised their fair heads and replied  but the reply was of such a nature that both the old ki and both the young ki-ki staggered backward in amazement  for one of the twin high ki said   they shall die  and the other twin high ki said at the same instant   they shall not die  had twin thunderbolts fallen through the twin roofs of the twin palaces and struck the twin ki and the twin ki-ki upon their twin heads it would have created no more stupendous a sensation than did this remark never before had any two halves of a twin of the land of twi thought differently or spoken differently  indeed it startled the two maidens themselves as much as it did their hearers for each one turned her head toward the other and for the first time in her life looked into the other's face  this act was fully as strange as their speech and a sudden horrible thought came into the startled heads of the twin ki and the twin ki-ki  the high ki of twi was no longer one but two  and these two were thinking and acting each independent of the other  it is no wonder the shock rendered them speechless for a time and they stood swaying their four bodies with their eight eyes bulging out like those of fishes and their four mouths wide open as if the two pairs had become one quartet  the faces of the two maids flushed as they gazed upon each other  how dare you contradict me asked one  how dare you contradict me demanded the other and not only were these questions asked separately but the accent on the words was different  and their twin minds seemed to get farther apart every moment  i'm the high ki of twi said one  you're not  i'm the high ki retorted the other  the strangers shall die snapped one  they shall live cried the other  my will is supreme  it's not  my will is supreme returned the other twin  the bald heads of the ancient ki were bobbing in amazement first to one maid and then toward the other  the blond hairs of the two ki-ki were standing almost on end and their eyes stared straight before them as if stupefied with astonishment  nerle was bellowing with rude laughter and holding his sides to keep from getting a stitch in them while prince marvel stood quietly attentive and smiling with genuine amusement  for he alone understood what had happened to separate the twin high ki  the girls did not seem to know how to act under their altered conditions  after a time one of them said   we will leave our dispute to be settled by the ki and the ki-ki  very well agreed the other  then i say your half is right declared the ki-ki both their right forefingers pointing to the maiden who had condemned the strangers to death  and i decide that your half is right exclaimed the ki both their trembling forefingers pointing to the maiden who had said the strangers should live  well said one girl  well said the other  the powers of the ki and the ki-ki are equal said the first  we are no nearer a settlement of our dispute than we were before  my dear young ladies said prince marvel politely i beg you will take time to think the matter over and see if you can not come to an agreement  we are in no hurry  very well decided the twins speaking both together this time  we command you all to remain in the palace until we have settled our own strange dispute  the servants will care for you and when we are ready to announce our decision we shall again send for you  every one bowed at this command and retired from the room but nerle looked over his shoulder as he went through the doorway and saw that the two high ki had turned in their seats and were facing each other and that both their faces wore angry and determined expressions    17  the separation of the high ki  for nearly a week prince marvel and nerle remained confined to the palace and gardens of the high ki  together with the twin ki who seemed to be friendly to them they occupied one of the twin palaces while the ki-ki secluded themselves in the other  the pretty high ki maidens they did not see at all nor did they know what part of the palaces they occupied not being permitted to wander away from the rooms allotted to them except to walk in the garden there was no way for them to escape had they felt inclined to for the silver steps had disappeared  from the garden walks they sometimes caught sight of the solemn heads of the handsome ki-ki looking at them through the twin windows of the other palace and although the expression of their faces was always mild and gentle nerle and marvel well knew the ki-ki were only waiting in the hope of having them killed  are you nervous about the decision of the pretty high ki asked nerle one day  no indeed said the prince laughing for i do not expect them to kill me in any event  if i felt as sure of my safety returned the boy it would destroy all my pleasure  these are really happy days for me  every moment i expect to see the executioner arrive with his ax  the executioner is double said the two old ki breaking into the conversation  you should say you expect to see the executioners arrive with their axes  then how will they cut off my head with two axes  for i suppose they will both chop at the same time and i have but one neck  wait and see answered the two ki sighing deeply and rubbing their red noses thoughtfully  oh i'll wait answered the boy but as for seeing them cut off my head i refuse for i intend to shut my eyes  so they sat in their rooms or walked in the gardens yawning and waiting until one day just as the two clocks on the wall were striking twenty-four o'clock the door opened and to their surprise one of the high ki twins walked in upon them  she was as sweet and fair to look upon as when she occupied one of the beautiful thrones but at first no one could tell which of the high ki she was their friend or their enemy  even the ki were puzzled and anxious until the girl said   my other half and i have completely separated for we have agreed to disagree for all time  and she has gone to ask the ki-ki to assist her for war is declared between us  and hereafter her color is to be the green and mine the yellow and we intend to fight until one of us conquers and overthrows the other  this announcement was interesting to marvel and nerle but greatly shocked the aged ki who asked   what is to become of our kingdom  half of a high ki can not rule it it is against the law  i will make my own laws when i have won the fight returned the girl with a lovely smile so do not let that bother you  and now tell me will you help me to fight my battles  willingly exclaimed nerle and prince marvel almost as if they had been twins of twi  and the ki rubbed their bald heads a moment and then sneezed together and wiped their eyes on faded yellow handkerchiefs and finally declared they would stick to her supreme highness through thick and thin  then go over the wall to the cities at once and get together all the soldiers to fight for me and my cause commanded the girl  the twin ki at once left the room and the high ki sat down and began to ask questions of prince marvel and nerle about the big outside world from whence they came  nerle was rather shy and bashful before the dainty little maiden whose yellow robe contrasted delightfully with her pink cheeks and blue eyes and brown flowing locks but prince marvel did not mind girls at all so he talked with her freely and she in return allowed him to examine the pretty gold crown she wore upon her brow  by and by the ki came back with both faces sad and gloomy  your highness they announced we have bad news for you  the other high ki who is wearing a green gown has been more prompt in action than yourself  she and the ki-ki have secured the silver steps and will allow no others to use them and already they have sent for the soldiers of the royal armies to come and aid them  so we are unable to leave the garden and presently the army will be here to destroy us  then the girl showed her good courage for she laughed and said   then we must remain here and fight to the last and if i am unable to save you who are my friends it will be because i can not save myself  this speech pleased prince marvel greatly  he kissed the little maid's hand respectfully and said   fear nothing your highness  my friend and i are not so helpless as you think  we consider it our privilege to protect and save you instead of your saving us and we are really able to do this in spite of the other high ki and her entire army  so they remained quietly in the palace the rest of that day and no one molested them in the least  in the evening the girl played and sang for them and the ancient pair of ki danced a double-shuffle for their amusement that nearly convulsed them with laughter  for one danced exactly like the other and the old men's legs were still very nimble although their wrinkled faces remained anxiously grave throughout their antics  nerle also sang a song about the king of thieves whom prince marvel had conquered and another about the red rogue of dawna so that altogether the evening passed pleasantly enough and they managed to forget all their uneasy doubts of the morrow  when at last they separated for the night prince marvel alone did not seek his bed there was still some business he wished to transact  so he shut himself up in his room and summoned before him by means of his fairy knowledge the prince of the knooks the king of the ryls and the governor of the goblins  these were all three his especial friends and he soon told them the story of the quarrel and separation of the twin high ki and claimed their assistance  then he told them how they might aid him and afterward dismissed them  having thus accomplished his task the fairy prince went to bed and slept peacefully the remainder of the night  the next morning the blond ki-ki and all the army of twi which had been won to their cause came climbing up the silver steps and over the wall to the palace of the green high ki but what was their amazement to find the twin palaces separated by a wall so high that no ladders nor steps they possessed could reach to the top  it had been built in a single night and only prince marvel and his fairy friends knew how the work had been done so quickly  the yellow high ki coming downstairs to breakfast with her friends found herself securely shut in from her enemies and the bald-headed old ki were so pleased to escape that they danced another jig from pure joy  over the wall could be heard the shouts and threats of the army of twi who were seeking a way to get at the fugitives but for the present our friends knew themselves to be perfectly safe and they could afford to laugh at the fury of the entire population of twi    18  the rescue of the high ki  after several days of siege prince marvel began to feel less confident of the safety of his little party  the frantic ki-ki had built double battering-rams and were trying to batter down the high wall and they had built several pairs of long ladders with which to climb over the wall and their soldiers were digging two tunnels in the ground in order to crawl under the wall  not at once could they succeed for the wall was strong and it would take long to batter it down and nerle stood on top of the wall and kicked over the ladders as fast as the soldiers of twi set them up and the gray-bearded ki stood in the garden holding two big flat boards with which to whack the heads of any who might come through the tunnels  but prince marvel realized that the perseverance of his foes might win in the end unless he took measures to defeat them effectually  so he summoned swift messengers from among the sound elves who are accustomed to travel quickly and they carried messages from him to wul-takim the king of the reformed thieves and to king terribus of spor who had both promised him their assistance in case he needed it the prince did not tell his friends of this action but after the messengers had been dispatched he felt easier in his mind  the little high ki remained as sweet and brave and lovable as ever striving constantly to cheer and encourage her little band of defenders  but none of them was very much worried and nerle confided to the maiden in yellow the fact that he expected to suffer quite agreeably when the ki-ki at last got him in their clutches  finally a day came when two big holes were battered through the wall and then the twin soldiers of twi poured through the holes and began to pound on the doors of the palace itself in which prince marvel and nerle the ki and the yellow high ki had locked themselves as securely as possible  the prince now decided it was high time for his friends to come to their rescue but they did not appear and before long the doors of the palace gave way and the soldiers rushed upon them in a vast throng  nerle wanted to fight and to slay as many of the twi people as possible but the prince would not let him  these poor soldiers are but doing what they consider their duty he said and it would be cruel to cut them down with our swords  have patience i pray you  our triumph will come in good time  the ki-ki who came into the palace accompanied by the green high ki ordered the twin soldiers to bind all the prisoners with cords  so one pair of soldiers bound the ki and another pair nerle and the prince using exactly the same motions in the operation  but when it came to binding the yellow high ki the scene was very funny  for twin soldiers tried to do the binding and there was only one to bind so that one soldier went through the same motions as his twin on empty air and when his other half had firmly bound the girl his own rope fell harmless to the ground  but it seemed impossible for one of the twins to do anything different from the other so that was the only way the act could be accomplished  then the green-robed high ki walked up to the one in yellow and laughed in her face saying   you now see which of us is the most powerful and therefore the most worthy to rule  had you remained faithful to our handsome ki-ki as i did you would not now be defeated and disgraced  there is no disgrace in losing one battle returned the other girl proudly  you are mistaken if you think you have conquered me and you are wrong to insult one who is for the time being your captive  the maiden in green looked for an instant confused and ashamed then she tossed her pretty head and walked away  they led all the prisoners out into the garden and then through the broken wall and up and down the silver steps into the great square of the cities of twi  and here all the population crowded around them for this was the first time any of them had seen their high ki or even known that they were girls and the news of their quarrel and separation had aroused a great deal of excitement  let the executioners come forward cried the ki-ki gleefully and in answer to the command the twin executioners stepped up to the prisoners  they were big men these executioners each having a squint in one eye and a scar on the left cheek  they polished their axes a moment on their coat-sleeves and then said to prince marvel and nerle who were to be the first victims   don't dodge please or our axes may not strike the right place  and do not be afraid for the blows will only hurt you an instant  in the land of twi it is usually considered a pleasure to be executed by us we are so exceedingly skillful  i can well believe that replied nerle although his teeth were chattering  but at this instant a loud shout was heard and the twin people of twi all turned their heads to find themselves surrounded by throngs of fierce enemies  prince marvel smiled for he saw among the new-comers the giants and dwarfs and the stern gray men of king terribus with their monarch calmly directing their movements and on the other side of the circle were the jolly faces and bushy whiskers of the fifty-nine reformed thieves with burly wul-takim at their head    19  the reunion of the high ki  the twins of twi were too startled and amazed to offer to fight with the odd people surrounding them  even the executioners allowed their axes to fall harmlessly to the ground and the double people soldiers and citizens alike turned to stare at the strangers in wonder  we're here prince yelled wul-takim his bristly beard showing over the heads of those who stood between  thank you answered prince marvel  and the men of spor are here added king terribus who was mounted on a fine milk-white charger richly caparisoned  i thank the men of spor returned prince marvel graciously  shall we cut your foes into small pieces or would you prefer to hang them questioned the king of the reformed thieves loudly enough to set most of his hearers shivering  but now the little maid in yellow stepped up to prince marvel and regarding the youthful knight with considerable awe said sweetly   i beg you will pardon my people and spare them  they are usually good and loyal subjects and if they fought against me their lawful high ki it was only because they were misled by my separation from my other half  that is true replied the prince and as you are still the lawful high ki of twi i will leave you to deal with your own people as you see fit  for those who have conquered your people are but your own allies and are still under your orders as i am myself  hearing this the green high ki walked up to her twin high ki and said boldly   i am your prisoner  it is now your turn  do with me as you will  i forgive you replied her sister in kindly tones  then the little maid who had met with defeat gave a sob and turned away weeping for she had expected anything but forgiveness  and now the ki-ki came forward and bowing their handsome blond heads before the high ki demanded  are we forgiven also  yes said the girl but you are no longer fit to be rulers of my people  therefore you are henceforth deprived of your honorable offices of ki-ki which i shall now bestow upon these good captains here and she indicated the good-natured officers who had first captured the prince and nerle  the people of twi eagerly applauded this act for the captains were more popular with them than the former ki-ki but the blond ones both flushed with humiliation and anger and said   the captains fought against you even as we did  yet the captains only obeyed your orders returned the high ki  so i hold them blameless  and what is to become of us now asked the former ki-ki  you will belong to the common people and earn your living playing tunes for them to dance by answered the high ki  and at this retort every one laughed so that the handsome youths turned away with twin scowls upon their faces and departed amidst the jeers of the crowd  better hang 'em to a tree little one shouted wul-takim in his big voice they won't enjoy life much anyhow  but the maid shook her pretty head and turned to the prince  will you stay here and help me to rule my kingdom she asked  i can not do that replied prince marvel for i am but a wandering adventurer and must soon continue my travels  but i believe you will be able to rule your people without my help  it is not so easy a task she answered sighing  for i am singular and my people are all double  well let us hold a meeting in your palace said the prince and then we can decide what is best to be done  so they dismissed the people who cheered their high ki enthusiastically returning quietly to their daily tasks and the gossip that was sure to follow such important events as they had witnessed  the army of king terribus and the fifty-nine reformed thieves went to the twin palaces of the ki and the ki-ki and made merry with feasting and songs to celebrate their conquest  and the high ki followed by the prince nerle king terribus and wul-takim as well as by the ki and the newly-appointed ki-ki mounted the silver steps and passed over the wall to the royal palaces  the green high ki followed them still weeping disconsolately  when they had all reached the throne-room the high ki seated herself on one of the beautiful thrones and said   by some strange chance which i am unable to explain my twin and i have become separated so that instead of thinking and acting alike we are now individuals as are all the strange men who have passed through the hole in the hedge  and being individuals we can no longer agree nor can one of us lawfully rule over the kingdom of twi where all the subjects are twins thinking and acting in unison  said prince marvel   your highness i alone can explain why you became separated from your twin  by means of a fairy enchantment which i learned years ago i worked upon you a spell which compelled your brain to work independent of your sister's brain  it seems to me that it is better each person should think her own thoughts and live her own life rather than be yoked to another person and obliged to think and act as a twin or one-half of a complete whole  and since you are now the one high ki and the acknowledged ruler of this country i will agree to work the same fairy spell on all your people so that no longer will there be twin minds in all this land of twi  but all the cows and dogs and horses and other animals are double as well as the people suggested the old ki blinking their little eyes in amazement at the thought of being forever separated from each other  i can also work the spell upon all the twin animals said the prince after a moment's hesitation  and all our houses are built double with twin doors and windows and chimneys to accommodate our twin people continued the high ki  and the trees and flowers and even the blades of grass are all double and our roads are double and and everything else is double  i alone the ruler of this land am singular  prince marvel became thoughtful now for he did not know how to separate trees and flowers and it would be a tedious task to separate the twin houses  why not leave the country as it is asked king terribus of spor the high ki is welcome to come to my castle to live and then she need no longer bother about the land of twi which seems to me a poor place after all  and your sister may come with me to my cave and be the queen of the reformed thieves which is a much more important office than being high ki of twi added big wul-takim who had placed the maiden in green upon a cushion at his feet and was striving to comfort her by gently stroking her silken hair with his rough hand  but i love my country and do not wish to leave it answered the yellow high ki  and i love my twin sister and regret that our minds have become separated she continued sadly  i have it exclaimed nerle  let the prince reunite you making you regular twins of twi again and then you can continue to rule the country as the double high ki and everything will be as it was before  the yellow high ki clapped her pink hands with delight and looked eagerly at the prince  will you she asked  will you please reunite us  and then all our troubles will be ended  this really seemed to marvel the best thing to be done  so he led the maid in green to the other throne where she had once sat and after replacing the golden crown upon her brow he whispered a fairy spell of much mystical power  then the prince stepped back and regarded the maidens earnestly and after a moment both the high ki smiled upon him in unison and said speaking the same words in the same voices and with the same accents   thank you very much    20  kwytoffle the tyrant  having restored the high ki to their former condition to the great joy of the ancient ki prince marvel led his friends back to the palaces where his men were waiting  they were just in time to prevent serious trouble for the fifty-eight reformed thieves had been boasting of their prowess to the huge giants and tiny dwarfs of king terribus and this had resulted in a quarrel as to which were the best fighters  had not their masters arrived at the right moment there would certainly have been a fierce battle and much bloodshed and all over something of no importance  terribus and wul-takim soon restored order and then they accompanied the ki and the ki-ki to the public square where the people were informed that their supreme highnesses the high ki had been reunited and would thereafter rule them with twin minds as well as twin bodies there was great rejoicing at this news for every twin in twi was glad to have his troubles ended so easily and satisfactorily  that night the ryls and knooks and other invisible friends of prince marvel came and removed the dividing wall between the twin palaces of the high ki repairing speedily all the damage that had been done  and when our friends called upon the high ki the next morning they found the two maids again dressed exactly alike in yellow robes with strings of sparkling emeralds for ornament  and not even prince marvel could now tell one of the high ki from the other  as for the maids themselves it seemed difficult to imagine they had ever existed apart for a single moment  they were very pleasant and agreeable to their new friends and when they heard that prince marvel was about to leave them to seek new adventures they said   please take us with you  it seems to us that we ought to know something of the big outside world from whence you came  if we see other kingdoms and people we shall be better able to rule our own wisely  that seems reasonable answered marvel and i shall be very glad to have you accompany me  but who will rule the land of twi in your absence  the ki-ki shall be the rulers answered the high ki and we will take the ki with us  then i will delay my departure until to-morrow morning said the prince in order that your highnesses may have time to prepare for the journey  and then he went back to the palaces of the other rulers where the ki expressed themselves greatly pleased at the idea of traveling and the new ki-ki were proud to learn they should rule for some time the land of twi  wul-takim also begged to join the party and so also did king terribus who had never before been outside of his own kingdom of spor so prince marvel willingly consented  the fifty-eight reformed thieves led by gunder returned to their cave where they were living comfortably on the treasure prince marvel had given them and the gray men and giants and dwarfs of spor departed for their own country  in the morning prince marvel led his own gay cavalcade through the hole in the hedge and they rode merrily away in search of adventure  by his side were the high ki mounted upon twin chestnut ponies that had remarkably slender limbs and graceful arched necks  the ponies moved with exactly the same steps and shook their manes and swished their tails at exactly the same time  behind the prince and the high ki were king terribus riding his great white charger and wul-takim on a stout horse of jet-black color  the two ancient ki and nerle being of lesser rank than the others brought up the rear  when we return to our land of twi said the high ki we shall close up for all time the hole you made in the hedge for if we are different from the rest of the world it is better that we remain in seclusion  i think it is right you should do that replied prince marvel  yet i do not regret that i cut a hole in your hedge  it was the hedge that delayed us in coming more promptly to your assistance said terribus for we had hard work to find the hole you had made and so lost much valuable time  all is well that ends well laughed the prince  you certainly came in good time to rescue us from our difficulties  they turned into a path that led to auriel which nerle had heard spoken of as the kingdom of the setting sun  soon the landscape grew very pleasant to look upon the meadows being broad and green with groups of handsome trees standing about  the twilight of the land of twi was now replaced by bright sunshine and in the air was the freshness of the near-by sea  at evening they came to a large farmhouse where the owner welcomed them hospitably and gave them the best his house afforded  in answer to their questions about the kingdom of auriel he shook his head sadly and replied   it is a rich and beautiful country but has fallen under great misfortunes  for when the good king died about two years ago the kingdom was seized by a fierce and cruel sorcerer named kwytoffle who rules the people with great severity and makes them bring him all their money and valuable possessions  so every one is now very poor and unhappy and that is a great pity in a country so fair and fertile  but why do not the people rebel asked nerle  they dare not rebel answered the farmer because they fear the sorcery of kwytoffle  if they do not obey him he threatens to change them into grasshoppers and june-bugs  has he ever changed any one into a grasshopper or a june-bug asked prince marvel  no but the people are too frightened to oppose him and so he does not get the opportunity  and he has an army of fierce soldiers who are accustomed to beat the people terribly if they do not carry every bit of their wealth to the sorcerer  so there is no choice but to obey him  we certainly ought to hang this wicked creature exclaimed wul-takim  i wish i had brought my fool-killer with me sighed king terribus for i could have kept him quite busy in this kingdom  can not something be done to rescue these poor people from their sad fate asked the lovely high ki anxiously  we will make a call upon this kwytoffle to-morrow answered prince marvel and see what the fellow is like  alas  alas wailed the good farmer you will all become grasshoppers and june-bugs every one of you  but none of the party seemed to fear that and having passed the night comfortably with the farmer they left his house and journeyed on into the kingdom of auriel  before noon they came upon the edge of a forest where a poor man was chopping logs into firewood  seeing prince marvel's party approach this man ran toward them waving his hands and shouting excitedly   take the other path  take the other path  and why should we take the other path inquired the prince reining in his steed  because this one leads to the castle of the great sorcerer kwytoffle answered the man  but there is where we wish to go said marvel  what  you wish to go there cried the man  then you will be robbed and enslaved  not as long as we are able to fight laughed the big wul-takim  if you resist the sorcerer you will be turned into grasshoppers and june-bugs declared the man staring at them in wonder  how do you know that asked marvel  kwytoffle says so  he promises to enchant every one who dares defy his power  has any one ever yet dared defy him asked nerle  certainly not said the man  no one wishes to become a june-bug or a grasshopper  no one dares defy him  i am anxious to see this sorcerer exclaimed king terribus  he ought to prove an interesting person for he is able to accomplish his purposes by threats alone  then let us ride on said marvel  dear us  dear us remonstrated the bald-headed ki are we to become grasshoppers then  we shall see returned the prince briefly  with your long legs added the pretty pair of high ki laughingly you ought to be able to jump farther than any other grasshopper in the kingdom  great kika-koo cried the ki nervously what a fate what a terrible fate  and your highnesses i suppose will become june-bugs and flutter your wings with noises like buzz-saws    21  the wonderful book of magic  whatever their fears might be none of prince marvel's party hesitated to follow him along the path through the forest in search of the sorcerer and by and by they came upon a large clearing  in the middle of this open space was a big building in such bad repair that its walls were tumbling down in several places and all around it the ground was uncared for and littered with rubbish  a man was walking up and down in front of this building with his head bowed low but when he heard the sound of approaching horses' hoofs he looked up and stared for a moment in amazement  then with a shout of rage he rushed toward them and caught prince marvel's horse by the bridle  how dare you he cried how dare you enter my forest  marvel jerked his bridle from the man's grasp and said in return   who are you  me  who am i  why i am the great and powerful kwytoffle  so beware  beware my sorcery  they all looked at the man curiously  he was short and very fat and had a face like a puff-ball with little red eyes and scarcely any nose at all  he wore a black gown with scarlet grasshoppers and june-bugs embroidered upon the cloth and his hat was high and peaked with an imitation grasshopper of extraordinary size perched upon its point  in his right hand he carried a small black wand and around his neck hung a silver whistle on a silver cord  seeing that the strangers were gazing on him so earnestly kwytoffle thought they were frightened so he said again in a big voice   beware my vengeance  beware yourself retorted the prince  for if you do not treat us more respectfully i shall have you flogged  what  flog me shouted kwytoffle furiously  for this i will turn every one of you into grasshoppers unless you at once give me all the wealth you possess  poor man exclaimed nerle i can see you are longing for that flogging  will you have it now and he raised his riding-whip above his head  kwytoffle stumbled backward a few paces and blew shrilly upon his silver whistle  instantly a number of soldiers came running from the building others following quickly after them until fully a hundred rough-looking warriors armed with swords and axes had formed in battle array facing the little party of prince marvel  arrest these strangers commanded kwytoffle in a voice like a roar capture them and bind them securely and then i will change them all into grasshoppers  all right answered the captain of the soldiers and then he turned to his men and shouted  forward double-quick march  they came on with drawn swords at first running and then gradually dropping into a walk as they beheld nerle wul-takim king terribus and marvel standing quietly waiting to receive them weapons in hand and ready for battle  a few paces off the soldiers hesitated and stopped altogether and kwytoffle yelled at the captain   why don't you go on  why don't you capture them  why don't you fight them  why they have drawn their swords responded the captain reproachfully  who cares roared the sorcerer  we care said the captain giving a shudder as he looked upon the strangers  their swords are sharp and some of us would get hurt  you're cowards shrieked the enraged kwytoffle  i'll turn you all into june-bugs  at this threat the soldiers dropped their swords and axes and all fell upon their knees trembling visibly and imploring their cruel master not to change them into june-bugs  bah cried nerle scornfully why don't you fight  if we kill you then you will escape being june-bugs  the fact is said the captain woefully we simply can't fight  for our swords are only tin and our axes are made of wood with silver-paper pasted over them  but why is that asked wul-takim while all the party showed their surprise  why until now we have never had any need to fight said the captain for every one has quickly surrendered to us or run away the moment we came near  but you people do not appear to be properly frightened and now alas since you have drawn upon us the great sorcerer's anger we shall all be transformed into june-bugs  yes roared kwytoffle hopping up and down with anger you shall all be june-bugs and these strangers i will transform into grasshoppers  very well said prince marvel quietly you can do it now  i will  i will cried the sorcerer  then why don't you begin inquired the prince  why don't i begin  why i haven't got the enchantments with me that's why  do you suppose we great magicians carry around enchantments in our pockets returned the other in a milder tone  where do you keep your enchantments asked the prince  they're in my dwelling snapped kwytoffle taking off his hat and fanning his fat face with the brim  then go and get them said marvel  nonsense  if i went to get the enchantments you would all run away retorted the sorcerer  not so protested nerle who was beginning to be amused  my greatest longing in life is to become a grasshopper  oh yes  please let us be grasshoppers exclaimed the high ki maids in the same breath  we want to hop  we want to hop  please please let us hop implored the bald-headed ki winking their left eyes at wul-takim  by all means let us become grasshoppers said king terribus smiling and wul-takim added   i'm sure your soldiers would enjoy being june-bugs for then they wouldn't have to work  isn't that so boys  the bewildered soldiers looked at one another in perplexity and the still more bewildered sorcerer gazed on the speakers with staring eyes and wide-open mouth  i insist said prince marvel upon your turning us into grasshoppers and your soldiers into june-bugs as you promised  if you do not then i will flog you as i promised  very well returned the sorcerer with a desperate look upon his face i'll go and find the enchantment  and we'll go with you remarked the prince pleasantly  so the entire party accompanied kwytoffle into the house where they entered a large room that was in a state of much disorder  let me see said the sorcerer rubbing his ears as if trying to think i wonder if i put them in this cupboard  you see he explained no one has ever before dared me to transform him into a june-bug or grasshopper so i have almost forgotten where i keep my book of enchantments  no it's not in the cupboard he continued looking there but it surely must be in this chest  it was not in the chest either and so the sorcerer continued to look in all sorts of queer places for his book of enchantments without finding it  whenever he paused in his search prince marvel would say sternly   go on  find the book  hunt it up  we are all anxious to become grasshoppers  and then kwytoffle would set to work again although big drops of perspiration were now streaming down his face  finally he pulled an old book from underneath the pillow of his bed and crying here it is carried it to the window  he turned a few leaves of the book and then said   how unfortunate  the compound i require to change you into grasshoppers must be mixed on the first day of september and as this is now the eighth day of september i must wait nearly a year before i can work the enchantment  how about the june-bugs asked nerle  oh  ah  the june-bug mixture can only be made at the dark o' the moon said the sorcerer pretending to read and that is three weeks from now  let me read it said prince marvel suddenly snatching the book from kwytoffle's hands  then he turned to the title-page and read   'lives of famous thieves and impostors'  why this is not a book of enchantments  that is what i suspected said terribus  no one but a sorcerer can read the enchantments in this book declared kwytoffle but he hung his head with a sheepish look for he knew his deception had been well understood  is your own history written in this volume inquired marvel  no answered the sorcerer  then it ought to be said the prince for you are no sorcerer at all but merely a thief and an impostor    22  the queen of plenta  the soldiers of kwytoffle wanted to hang their old master at once for he had won their enmity by abusing them in many ways but prince marvel would not let them do this  however they tied the false sorcerer to a post and the captain gave him a good whipping one lash for each letter in the words grasshopper and june-bug  kwytoffle howled loudly for mercy but no one was at all sorry for him  wul-takim tied a rope around the impostor's neck and when the party left the castle they journeyed all through the kingdom of auriel and at every town or city they came to the reformed thief would cry out to the populace   here is the terrible sorcerer kwytoffle who threatened to change you into grasshoppers and june-bugs  but you may see that he is a very common man with no powers of sorcery whatever  and then the people would laugh and pelt mud at their former tyrant and thank prince marvel for haying exposed the false and wicked creature  and they called the son of their old king back to his lawful throne where he ruled wisely and well and the hoarded wealth of kwytoffle was divided among the people again and soon the country became prosperous once more  this adventure was very amusing to the pretty high ki of twi  it afforded them laughter for many days and none of the party ever saw a grasshopper or a june-bug afterward without thinking of the terrible sorcerer kwytoffle  they left that disgraced person grooming horses for his board in the stables of the new king and proceeded upon their journey  without further event they reached the splendid southern kingdom of plenta which was the most delightfully situated of any dominion in the enchanted island of yew  it was ruled by a good and generous queen who welcomed the strangers to her palace and gave a series of gay entertainments in their honor  king terribus was especially an object of interest for every one had heard his name and feared him and his fierce people  but when they beheld his pleasant countenance and listened to his gentle voice they began to regard him with much love and respect and really terribus was worthy of their friendship since he had changed from a deformed monster into an ordinary man and had forbidden his people ever again to rob and plunder their weaker neighbors  but the most popular personages visiting at the court of the queen of plenta were the lovely high ki of twi  although beautiful girls abounded in this kingdom none could compare with the royal twins and their peculiar condition only served to render them the more interesting  two youths would approach the high ki at the same time and invite them to dance and in united voices they would accept the invitation and go whirling around the room with exactly the same steps laughing at the same instant and enjoying the dance equally  but if one youth asked his partner a question both the twins would make answer and that was sure to confuse and embarrass the youth  still the maids managed very well to adapt themselves to the ways of people who were singular although they sometimes became a little homesick for twi where they were like all the other people  the bald-headed ki kept watchful eyes on their youthful rulers and served them very cheerfully  but with all their travels and experiences the old men could never be convinced it was better to be singular than double  prince marvel was the real hero of the party and nerle received much attention on account of his master's popularity  he did not seem as unhappy as usual and when the prince inquired the reason his esquire answered that he believed the excitement of their adventures was fast curing him of his longing for something he could not have  as for the pleasure of suffering he had had some experience of that too and it was not nearly so delightful as he had expected  wul-takim was not a society man so he stayed around the royal stables and made friends with the grooms and traded his big black horse for two bay ones and a gold neck-chain and was fairly content with his lot  and so the party enjoyed several happy weeks at the court of the good queen of plenta until one day the terrible news arrived that carried them once more into exciting adventures    23  the red rogue of dawna  one morning while they were all standing in the courtyard waiting for their horses as they were about to go for a ride a courier came galloping swiftly up to the palace and cried   does any one know where prince marvel can be found  i am prince marvel replied the young knight stepping out from among the others  then have i reached my journey's end said the courier whose horse was nearly exhausted from long and hard riding  the lady seseley is in great danger and sends for you to come and rescue her  the great baron merd her father has been killed and his castle destroyed and all his people are either captives or have been slain outright  and who has done this evil thing asked prince marvel looking very stern and grave  the red rogue of dawna answered the messenger  he quarreled with the baron merd and sent his savage hordes to tear down his castle and slay him  i myself barely escaped with my life and the lady seseley had but time to say before she was carried off that if i could find prince marvel he would surely rescue her  and so i will declared the prince if she be still alive  who is this lady seseley asked nerle who had come to his master's side  she is my first friend to whom i owe my very existence  it is her image together with those of her two friends which is graven on my shield answered prince marvel thoughtfully  and what will you do inquired the esquire  i must go to her at once  when they heard of his mission all the party insisted on accompanying him  even the dainty high ki could not be deterred by any thoughts of dangers they might encounter and after some discussion prince marvel allowed them to join him  so wul-takim sharpened his big broadsword and nerle carefully prepared his master's horse so that before an hour had passed they were galloping toward the province of the red rogue of dawna  prince marvel knew little concerning this personage but nerle had much to tell of him  the red rogue had once been page to a wise scholar and magician who lived in a fine old castle in dawna and ruled over a large territory  the boy was very small and weak smaller even than the average dwarf and his master did not think it worth while to watch him  but one evening while the magician was standing upon the top of the highest tower of his castle the boy gave him a push from behind and he met death on the sharp rocks below  then the boy took his master's book of magic and found a recipe to make one grow  he made the mixture and swallowed it and straightway began to grow big and tall  this greatly delighted him until he found he was getting much bigger than the average man and rapidly becoming a giant  so he sought for a way to arrest the action of the magical draft but before he could find it he had grown to enormous proportions and was bigger than the biggest giant  there was nothing in the book of magic to make one grow smaller so he was obliged to remain as he was the largest man in the enchanted island  all this had happened in a single night  the morning after his master's murder the page announced himself lord of the castle and seeing his enormous size none dared deny his right to rule  on account of his bushy hair which was fiery red in color and the bushy red beard that covered his face when he became older people came to call him the red one  and after his evil deeds and quarrelsome temper had made him infamous throughout the island people began to call him the red rogue of dawna  he had gathered around him a number of savage barbarians as wicked and quarrelsome as himself and so none dared to interfere with him or even to meet him if it were possible to avoid it  this same red rogue it was who had drawn the good baron merd into a quarrel and afterward slain the old knight and his followers destroyed his castle and carried his little daughter seseley and her girl friends berna and helda into captivity shutting them up in his own gloomy castle  the red rogue thought he had done a very clever thing and had no fear of the consequences until one of his men came running up to the castle to announce that prince marvel and his companions were approaching to rescue the lady seseley  how many of them are there demanded the red rogue  there are eight altogether answered the man but two of them are girls  and they expect to force me to give up my captives asked the red one laughing with a noise like the roar of a waterfall  why i shall make prisoners of every one of them  the man looked at his master fearfully and replied   this prince marvel is very famous and all people speak of his bravery and power  it was he who conquered king terribus of spor and that mighty ruler is now his friend and is one of the eight who approach  the red rogue stopped laughing for the fame of spor's terrible king had long ago reached him  and he reflected that any one who could conquer the army of giants and dwarfs and gray men that served terribus must surely be one to be regarded seriously  moreover and this was a secret the red rogue had never been able to gain the strength to correspond with his gigantic size but had ever remained as weak as when he was a puny boy  so he was accustomed to rely on his cunning and on the terror his very presence usually excited to triumph over his enemies  and he began to be afraid of this prince  you say two of the party are girls he asked  yes said the man but also among them are king terribus himself and the renowned wul-takim formerly king of thieves who was conquered by the prince although accounted a hard fighter and is now his devoted servant  and there are two old men who are just alike and have a very fierce look about them  they are said to come from the hidden kingdom of twi  by this time the red rogue was thoroughly frightened but he did not yet despair of defeating his enemies  he knew better than to attempt to oppose prince marvel by force but he still hoped to conquer him by trickery and deceit  among the wonderful things that the red rogue's former master the wise scholar and magician had made were two large enchanted mirrors which were set on each side of the great hallway of the castle  heavy curtains were drawn over the surfaces of these mirrors because they both possessed a dreadful magical power  for whenever any one looked into one of them his reflection was instantly caught and imprisoned in the mirror and his body at the same time became invisible to all earthly eyes only the mirror retaining his form  while considering a way to prevent the prince from freeing the lady seseley the red rogue happened to think of these mirrors which had never yet been used  so he went stealthily into the great hall and drew aside the covering from one of the mirrors  he did not dare look into the mirror himself but hurried away to another room and then sent a page up a back stairway to summon the lady seseley and her two maids into his presence  the girls at once obeyed for they greatly feared the red rogue and of course they descended the front stairway and walked through the great hall  at once the large mirror that had been exposed to view caught the eye of seseley and she paused to regard her reflection in the glass  her two companions did likewise and instantly all three girls became invisible while the mirror held their reflections fast in its magic surface  the red rogue was watching them through a crack in the door and seeing the girls disappear he gave a joyful laugh and exclaimed   now let prince marvel find them if he can  the three girls began to wander aimlessly through the castle for not only were they invisible to others but also to themselves and to one another and they knew not what to do nor which way to turn    24  the enchanted mirrors  presently prince marvel and his party arrived and paused before the doors of the castle where the red rogue stood bowing to them with mock politeness and with an evil grin showing on his red face  i come to demand the release of the lady seseley and her companions prince marvel announced in a bold voice  and i also intend to call you to account for the murder of baron merd  you must be at the wrong castle answered the red one for i have murdered no baron nor have i any lady seseley as prisoner  are you not the red rogue of dawna demanded the prince  men call me by that name acknowledged the other  then you are deceiving me said the prince  no indeed answered the red rogue mockingly  i wouldn't deceive any one for the world  but if you don't believe me you are welcome to search my castle  that i shall do returned the prince sternly whether i have your permission or not and he began to dismount  but nerle restrained him saying   master i beg you will allow me to search the castle  for this red rogue is playing some trick upon us i am sure and if anything happened to you there would be no one to protect the little high ki and our other friends  but suppose something should happen to you inquired the prince anxiously  in that case said nerle you can avenge me  the advice was so reasonable under the circumstances that the prince decided to act upon it  very well said he go and search the castle and i will remain with our friends  but if anything happens to you i shall call the red rogue to account  so nerle entered the castle passing by the huge form of its owner who only nodded to the boy and grinned with delight  the esquire found himself in the great hall and began to look around him but without seeing any one  then he advanced a few steps and to his surprise discovered a large mirror in which were reflected the faces and forms of three girls as well as his own  why here they are he attempted to say but he could not hear his own voice  he glanced down at himself but could see nothing at all for his body had become invisible  his reflection was still in the glass and he knew that his body existed the same as before but although he yet saw plainly the hall and all that it contained he could see neither himself nor any other person of flesh  after waiting a considerable time for his esquire to reappear prince marvel became impatient  what have you done with nerle he asked of the red rogue  nothing was the reply  i have been here plainly within your sight every moment  let me go and find him exclaimed king terribus and rushed into the castle before the prince could reply  but terribus also encountered the enchanted mirror and the prince waited in vain for his return  then wul-takim volunteered to go in search of the others and drew his big sharp sword before entering the hall  but an hour passed by and he did not return  the red rogue was overjoyed at the success of his stratagem and could scarce refrain from laughing outright at the prince's anxiety  marvel was really perplexed  he knew some treachery was afoot but could not imagine what it was  and when the pretty high ki declared their intention of entering the castle he used every endeavor to dissuade them  but the twin girls would not be denied so great was their curiosity  so the prince said   well we will all go together so that the ki and i may be able to protect you  the red rogue gladly granted them admittance and they passed him and entered the great hall  the place appeared to them to be completely empty so they walked along and came opposite the mirror  here all stopped at once and the twin high ki uttered exclamations of surprise and the twin ki shouted great kika-koo  for there in the glass were the reflections of the three girls and nerle and king terribus and wul-takim  and there were also the reflections of the twin high ki and the twin ki only prince marvel's reflection was missing and this was because of his fairy origin  for the glass could reflect and hold only the forms of mortals  but the prince saw the reflections of all the others and then made the discovery that the forms of the ki and the high ki had become invisible  no one except himself appeared to be standing in the great hall of the red rogue's castle  yet grouped within the glass were the likenesses of all his friends as well as those of lady seseley and her companions and all were staring back at him earnestly as if imploring him to save them  the mystery was now explained and prince marvel rushed from the hall to find the treacherous red rogue  but that clever trickster had hidden himself in an upper room and for the present was safely concealed  for a time prince marvel could not think what to do  such magic was all unknown to him and how to free the imprisoned forms of his friends was a real problem  he walked around the castle but no one was in sight the rogue having given orders to all his people to keep away only the tethered horses did he see and these raised their heads and whinnied as if in sympathy with his perplexity  then he went back into the hall and searched all the rooms of the castle without finding a single person  on his return he stopped in front of the mirror and sorrowfully regarded the faces of his friends who again seemed to plead for relief  and while he looked a sudden fit of anger came over him at being outwitted by this red rogue of dawna  scarcely knowing what he did he seized his sword by the blade and struck the mirror a powerful blow with the heavy hilt  it shattered into a thousand fragments which fell clattering upon the stone floor in every direction  and at once the charm was broken each of his friends now became visible  they appeared running toward him from all parts of the castle where they had been wandering in their invisible forms  they called out joyful greetings to one another and then all of them surrounded the prince and thanked him earnestly for releasing them  the little lady seseley and her friends berna and helda were a bit shy in the presence of so many strangers but they alone knew the prince's secret and that he was a fairy transformed for a year so they regarded him as an old and intimate acquaintance and after being introduced by him to the others of his party they became more at ease  the sweet little high ki maids at once attracted seseley and she loved them almost at first sight  but it was nerle who became the little lady's staunchest friend for there was something rather mystical and unnatural to him about the high ki who seemed almost like fairies while in seseley he recognized a hearty substantial girl of his own rank in life  while they stood talking and congratulating one another outside of the castle the red rogue of dawna appeared among them  he had heard the noise of the smashing of his great mirror and had come running downstairs from his hiding-place to find his cunning had all been for naught and his captives were free  a furious anger then took possession of the rogue and forgetting his personal weakness he caught up a huge battle-ax and rushed out to hurl himself upon prince marvel intending to do him serious injury  but the prince was not taken unawares  he saw the red rogue coming and met him with drawn sword striking quickly at the arm that wielded the big ax  the stroke was as sure as it was quick and piercing the arm of the giant caused him to drop the ax with a howl of pain  then prince marvel seized the red rogue by the ear which he was just tall enough to reach and dragged him up the steps and into the castle the big fellow crying for mercy at every step and trembling like a leaf through cowardice  but down the hall marvel marched him seeking some room where the rogue might be safely locked in  the great curtain that covered the second enchanted mirror now caught prince marvel's eye and still holding his prisoner by the ear he reached out his left hand and pulled aside the drapery  the red rogue looked to see what his captor was doing and beheld his own reflection in the magic mirror  instantly he gave a wild cry and disappeared his body becoming absolutely invisible while his coarse red countenance stared back from the mirror  and then prince marvel gave a sigh of relief and dropped the curtain over the surface of the mirror  for he realized that the red rogue of dawna had at last met with just punishment and was safely imprisoned for all time    25  the adventurers separate  when prince marvel and his friends had ridden away from the castle the savage followers of the red one came creeping up to listen for their master's voice  but silence reigned in every part of the castle and after stealing fearfully through the rooms without seeing any one the fellows became filled with terror and fled from the place never to return  and afterward the neighbors whispered that the castle was haunted by the spirit of the terrible red rogue and travelers dared not stop in the neighborhood but passed by quickly and with averted faces  the prince and his party rode gaily along toward the kingdom of heg for nerle had invited them all to visit his father's castle  they were very happy over their escape and only the little lady seseley became sad at times when she thought of her father's sad fate  the baron neggar who was nerle's father was not only a wealthy nobleman but exceedingly kind and courteous so that every member of prince marvel's party was welcomed to the big castle in a very hospitable manner  nerle was eagerly embraced by both his father and mother who were overjoyed to see him return safe and sound after his wanderings and adventures  and have you been cured of your longing for something that you can not have asked the baron anxiously  not quite said nerle laughing but i am more reconciled to my lot for i find wherever i go people are longing for just the things they can not get and probably would not want if they had them  so as it seems to be the fate of most mortals to live unsatisfied i shall try hereafter to be more contented  these words delighted the good baron and he gave a rich and magnificent feast in honor of his son's return  the high ki of twi after passing several pleasant days at nerle's home now decided that they had seen enough of the world and would be glad to return to their own kingdom where all was peaceful and uneventful and rule it to the end of their days  so the baron furnished them an escort of twenty men-at-arms and these conducted the high ki and the aged ki safely back to the hole in the hedge  and after they had entered the land of twi the first act of the high ki was to order the hedge repaired and the hole blocked up and i have never heard that any one from that time forth ever succeeded in gaining admittance to the hidden kingdom  so its subsequent history is unknown  king terribus also bade the prince an affectionate farewell and rode back to his own kingdom and burly wul-takim accompanied him as far as the cave where the fifty-eight reformed thieves awaited him  nerle's mother gladly adopted the lady seseley and her two companions and thereafter they made their home at the baron's castle  and years afterward when they had grown to be women seseley was married to nerle and became the lady of the castle herself  prince marvel enjoyed the feasting and dancing at the castle very much but after the party began to break up and the high ki and the ki had left him as well as king terribus and honest wul-takim the young knight grew thoughtful and sometimes uneasy and his happy laugh was less frequently heard  nerle often regarded his young master with a feeling of awe for there occasionally came a look into marvel's eyes that reminded him more of the immortals than of any human being  but the prince treated him with rare kindness and always pressed nerle's hand affectionately when he bade him good night for he had grown fond of his esquire  also they had long conversations together during which nerle gleaned a great deal of knowledge and received some advice that was of much use to him in his later life  one day prince marvel sought out lady seseley and said   will you ride with me to the forest of lurla  willingly she answered and calling berna and helda to attend them they mounted their horses and rode swiftly away for it was a long distance to lurla  by noon the party entered the forest and although the path they traversed was unknown to the girls who had usually entered the forest from its other side near to where the baron merd's castle had stood the prince seemed to have no difficulty in finding his way  he guided them carefully along the paths his handsome war-charger stepping with much grace and dignity until at length they came to a clearing  here the prince paused abruptly and seseley looked around her and at once recognized the place  why she exclaimed in surprise it is the fairy bower  and then she turned to prince marvel and asked in a soft voice   is the year ended prince  his smile was a bit sad as he answered slowly   the year will be ended in five minutes    26  the end of the year  the girls sat upon the green moss and waited  prince marvel stood silent beside his horse  the silver armor was as bright as the day he donned it nor was there a dent in his untarnished shield  the sword that had done such good service he held lightly in his hand and the horse now and then neighed softly and turned to look at him with affectionate eyes  seseley began to tremble with excitement and berna and helda stared at the prince with big round eyes  but after all they saw nothing so remarkable as they expected  for presently and it all happened in a flash prince marvel was gone from their midst and a handsome slender-limbed deer darted from the bower and was quickly lost in the thick forest  on the ground lay a sheet of bark and a twig from a tree and beside them was lady seseley's white velvet cloak  then the three girls each drew a long breath and looked into one another's eyes and while thus engaged a peal of silvery laughter sounded in their ears and made them spring quickly to their feet  before them stood a tiny and very beautiful fairy clothed in floating gossamer robes of rose and pearl color and with eyes sparkling like twin stars  prince marvel exclaimed the three together  no indeed cried the fairy with a pretty little pout  i am no one but myself and really i believe i shall now be content to exist for a few hundred years in my natural form  i have quite enjoyed my year as a mortal but after all there are i find some advantages in being a fairy  good by my dears  and with another ripple of laughter the pretty creature vanished and the girls were left alone    27  a hundred years afterward  about a hundred years after prince marvel enjoyed his strange adventures in the enchanted island of yew an odd thing happened  a hidden mirror in a crumbling old castle of dawna broke loose from its fastenings and fell crashing on the stone pavement of the deserted hall  and from amid the ruins rose the gigantic form of a man  his hair and beard were a fiery red and he gazed at the desolation around him in absolute amazement  it was the red rogue of dawna set free from his imprisonment  he wandered out and found strange scenes confronting him for during the hundred years a great change had taken place in the enchanted island  great cities had been built and great kingdoms established civilization had won the people and they no longer robbed or fought or indulged in magical arts but were busily employed and leading respectable lives  when the red rogue tried to tell folks who he was they but laughed at him thinking the fellow crazy  he tried to get together a band of thieves as wul-takim had done in the old days but none would join him  and so forced to be honest against his will the rogue was driven to earn a living by digging in the garden of a wealthy noble of whom he had never before heard  but often he would pause in his labors and lean on his spade while thoughts of the old days of wild adventure passed through his mind in rapid succession and then the big man would shake his red head with a puzzled air and mutter   i wonder who that prince marvel could have been  and i wonder what ever became of him "@"The Enchanted Island of Yew"@"L.Frank Baum"

years of revolution but times change because men change and because civilization like john brown's soul goes ever marching on  the impossibilities of yesterday become the accepted facts of to-day  here is a fairy tale founded upon the wonders of electricity and written for children of this generation  yet when my readers shall have become men and women my story may not seem to their children like a fairy tale at all  perhaps one perhaps two perhaps several of the demon's devices will be by that time in popular use  who knows     1  rob's workshop   when rob became interested in electricity his clear-headed father considered the boy's fancy to be instructive as well as amusing so he heartily encouraged his son and rob never lacked batteries motors or supplies of any sort that his experiments might require  he fitted up the little back room in the attic as his workshop and from thence a net-work of wires soon ran throughout the house  not only had every outside door its electric bell but every window was fitted with a burglar alarm moreover no one could cross the threshold of any interior room without registering the fact in rob's workshop the gas was lighted by an electric fob a chime connected with an erratic clock in the boy's room woke the servants at all hours of the night and caused the cook to give warning a bell rang whenever the postman dropped a letter into the box there were bells bells bells everywhere ringing at the right time the wrong time and all the time and there were telephones in the different rooms too through which rob could call up the different members of the family just when they did not wish to be disturbed  his mother and sisters soon came to vote the boy's scientific craze a nuisance but his father was delighted with these evidences of rob's skill as an electrician and insisted that he be allowed perfect freedom in carrying out his ideas  electricity said the old gentleman sagely is destined to become the motive power of the world  the future advance of civilization will be along electrical lines  our boy may become a great inventor and astonish the world with his wonderful creations  and in the meantime said the mother despairingly we shall all be electrocuted or the house burned down by crossed wires or we shall be blown into eternity by an explosion of chemicals  nonsense ejaculated the proud father  rob's storage batteries are not powerful enough to electrocute one or set the house on fire  do give the boy a chance belinda  and the pranks are so humiliating continued the lady  when the minister called yesterday and rang the bell a big card appeared on the front door on which was printed the words  'busy call again' fortunately helen saw him and let him in but when i reproved robert for the act he said he was just trying the sign to see if it would work  exactly  the boy is an inventor already  i shall have one of those cards attached to the door of my private office at once  i tell you belinda our son will be a great man one of these days said mr joslyn walking up and down with pompous strides and almost bursting with the pride he took in his young hopeful  mrs joslyn sighed  she knew remonstrance was useless so long as her husband encouraged the boy and that she would be wise to bear her cross with fortitude  rob also knew his mother's protests would be of no avail so he continued to revel in electrical processes of all sorts using the house as an experimental station to test the powers of his productions  it was in his own room however his workshop that he especially delighted  for not only was it the center of all his numerous lines throughout the house but he had rigged up therein a wonderful array of devices for his own amusement  a trolley-car moved around a circular track and stopped regularly at all stations an engine and train of cars moved jerkily up and down a steep grade and through a tunnel a windmill was busily pumping water from the dishpan into the copper skillet a sawmill was in full operation and a host of mechanical blacksmiths scissors-grinders carpenters wood-choppers and millers were connected with a motor which kept them working away at their trades in awkward but persevering fashion  the room was crossed and recrossed with wires  they crept up the walls lined the floor made a grille of the ceiling and would catch an unwary visitor under the chin or above the ankle just when he least expected it  yet visitors were forbidden in so crowded a room and even his father declined to go farther than the doorway  as for rob he thought he knew all about the wires and what each one was for but they puzzled even him at times and he was often perplexed to know how to utilize them all  one day when he had locked himself in to avoid interruption while he planned the electrical illumination of a gorgeous pasteboard palace he really became confused over the network of wires  he had a switchboard to be sure where he could make and break connections as he chose but the wires had somehow become mixed and he could not tell what combinations to use to throw the power on to his miniature electric lights  so he experimented in a rather haphazard fashion connecting this and that wire blindly and by guesswork in the hope that he would strike the right combination  then he thought the combination might be right and there was a lack of power so he added other lines of wire to his connections and still others until he had employed almost every wire in the room  yet it would not work and after pausing a moment to try to think what was wrong he went at it again putting this and that line into connection adding another here and another there until suddenly as he made a last change a quick flash of light almost blinded him and the switch-board crackled ominously as if struggling to carry a powerful current  rob covered his face at the flash but finding himself unhurt he took away his hands and with blinking eyes attempted to look at a wonderful radiance which seemed to fill the room making it many times brighter than the brightest day  although at first completely dazzled he peered before him until he discovered that the light was concentrated near one spot from which all the glorious rays seemed to scintillate  he closed his eyes a moment to rest them then re-opening them and shading them somewhat with his hands he made out the form of a curious being standing with majesty and composure in the center of the magnificent radiance and looking down upon him     2  the demon of electricity   rob was a courageous boy but a thrill of fear passed over him in spite of his bravest endeavor as he gazed upon the wondrous apparition that confronted him  for several moments he sat as if turned to stone so motionless was he but his eyes were nevertheless fastened upon the being and devouring every detail of his appearance  and how strange an appearance he presented  his jacket was a wavering mass of white light edged with braid of red flames that shot little tongues in all directions  the buttons blazed in golden fire  his trousers had a bluish incandescent color with glowing stripes of crimson braid  his vest was gorgeous with all the colors of the rainbow blended into a flashing resplendent mass  in feature he was most majestic and his eyes held the soft but penetrating brilliance of electric lights  it was hard to meet the gaze of those searching eyes but rob did it and at once the splendid apparition bowed and said in a low clear voice   i am here  i know that answered the boy trembling but why are you here  because you have touched the master key of electricity and i must obey the laws of nature that compel me to respond to your summons  i i didn't know i touched the master key faltered the boy  i understand that  you did it unconsciously  no one in the world has ever done it before for nature has hitherto kept the secret safe locked within her bosom  rob took time to wonder at this statement  then who are you he inquired at length  the demon of electricity was the solemn answer  good gracious exclaimed rob a demon  certainly  i am in truth the slave of the master key and am forced to obey the commands of any one who is wise and brave enough or as in your own case fortunate and fool-hardy enough to touch it  i i've never guessed there was such a thing as a master key or or a demon of electricity and and i'm awfully sorry i i called you up stammered the boy abashed by the imposing appearance of his companion  the demon actually smiled at this speech a smile that was almost reassuring  i am not sorry he said in kindlier tone for it is not much pleasure waiting century after century for some one to command my services  i have often thought my existence uncalled for since you earth people are so stupid and ignorant that you seem unlikely ever to master the secret of electrical power  oh we have some great masters among us cried rob rather nettled at this statement  now there's edison   edison exclaimed the demon with a faint sneer what does he know  lots of things declared the boy  he's invented no end of wonderful electrical things  you are wrong to call them wonderful replied the demon lightly he really knows little more than yourself about the laws that control electricity  his inventions are trifling things in comparison with the really wonderful results to be obtained by one who would actually know how to direct the electric powers instead of groping blindly after insignificant effects  why i've stood for months by edison's elbow hoping and longing for him to touch the master key but i can see plainly he will never accomplish it  then there's tesla said the boy  the demon laughed  there is tesla to be sure he said  but what of him  why he's discovered a powerful light the demon gave an amused chuckle and he's in communication with the people in mars  what people  why the people who live there  there are none  this great statement almost took rob's breath away and caused him to stare hard at his visitor  it's generally thought he resumed in an annoyed tone that mars has inhabitants who are far in advance of ourselves in civilization many scientific men think the people of mars have been trying to signal us for years only we don't understand their signals  and great novelists have written about the martians and their wonderful civilization and   and they all know as much about that little planet as you do yourself interrupted the demon impatiently  the trouble with you earth people is that you delight in guessing about what you can not know  now i happen to know all about mars because i can traverse all space and have had ample leisure to investigate the different planets mars is not peopled at all nor is any other of the planets you recognize in the heavens  some contain low orders of beasts to be sure but earth alone has an intelligent thinking reasoning population and your scientists and novelists would do better trying to comprehend their own planet than in groping through space to unravel the mysteries of barren and unimportant worlds  rob listened to this with surprise and disappointment but he reflected that the demon ought to know what he was talking about so he did not venture to contradict him  it is really astonishing continued the apparition how little you people have learned about electricity  it is an earth element that has existed since the earth itself was formed and if you but understood its proper use humanity would be marvelously benefited in many ways  we are already protested rob our discoveries in electricity have enabled us to live much more conveniently  then imagine your condition were you able fully to control this great element replied the other gravely  the weaknesses and privations of mankind would be converted into power and luxury  that's true mr mr demon said the boy  excuse me if i don't get your name right but i understood you to say you are a demon  certainly  the demon of electricity  but electricity is a good thing you know and and   well  i've always understood that demons were bad things added rob boldly  not necessarily returned his visitor  if you will take the trouble to consult your dictionary you will find that demons may be either good or bad like any other class of beings  originally all demons were good yet of late years people have come to consider all demons evil  i do not know why  should you read hesiod you will find he says     'soon was a world of holy demons made   aerial spirits by great jove designed   to be on earth the guardians of mankind'   but jove was himself a myth objected rob who had been studying mythology  the demon shrugged his shoulders  then take the words of mr shakespeare to whom you all defer he replied  do you not remember that he says     'thy demon that's thy spirit which keeps thee is   noble courageous high unmatchable'   oh if shakespeare says it that's all right answered the boy  but it seems you're more like a genius for you answer the summons of the master key of electricity in the same way aladdin's genius answered the rubbing of the lamp  to be sure  a demon is also a genius and a genius is a demon said the being  what matters a name  i am here to do your bidding     3  the three gifts   familiarity with any great thing removes our awe of it  the great general is only terrible to the enemy the great poet is frequently scolded by his wife the children of the great statesman clamber about his knees with perfect trust and impunity the great actor who is called before the curtain by admiring audiences is often waylaid at the stage door by his creditors  so rob having conversed for a time with the glorious demon of electricity began to regard him with more composure and less awe as his eyes grew more and more accustomed to the splendor that at first had well-nigh blinded them  when the demon announced himself ready to do the boy's bidding he frankly replied   i am no skilled electrician as you very well know  my calling you here was an accident  so i don't know how to command you nor what to ask you to do  but i must not take advantage of your ignorance answered the demon also i am quite anxious to utilize this opportunity to show the world what a powerful element electricity really is  so permit me to inform you that having struck the master key you are at liberty to demand from me three gifts each week for three successive weeks  these gifts provided they are within the scope of electricity i will grant  rob shook his head regretfully  if i were a great electrician i should know what to ask he said but i am too ignorant to take advantage of your kind offer  then replied the demon i will myself suggest the gifts and they will be of such a character that the earth people will learn the possibilities that lie before them and be encouraged to work more intelligently and to persevere in mastering those natural and simple laws which control electricity  for one of the greatest errors they now labor under is that electricity is complicated and hard to understand  it is really the simplest earth element lying within easy reach of any one who stretches out his hand to grasp and control its powers  rob yawned for he thought the demon's speeches were growing rather tiresome  perhaps the genius noticed this rudeness for he continued   i regret of course that you are a boy instead of a grown man for it will appear singular to your friends that so thoughtless a youth should seemingly have mastered the secrets that have baffled your most learned scientists  but that can not be helped and presently you will become through my aid the most powerful and wonderful personage in all the world  thank you said rob meekly  it'll be no end of fun  fun echoed the demon scornfully  but never mind i must use the material fate has provided for me and make the best of it  what will you give me first asked the boy eagerly  that requires some thought returned the demon and paused for several moments while rob feasted his eyes upon the gorgeous rays of color that flashed and vibrated in every direction and surrounded the figure of his visitor with an intense glow that resembled a halo  then the demon raised his head and said   the thing most necessary to man is food to nourish his body  he passes a considerable part of his life in the struggle to procure food to prepare it properly and in the act of eating  this is not right your body can not be very valuable to you if all your time is required to feed it  i shall therefore present you as my first gift this box of tablets  within each tablet are stored certain elements of electricity which are capable of nourishing a human body for a full day  all you need do is to toss one into your mouth each day and swallow it  it will nourish you satisfy your hunger and build up your health and strength  the ordinary food of mankind is more or less injurious this is entirely beneficial  moreover you may carry enough tablets in your pocket to last for months  here he presented rob the silver box of tablets and the boy somewhat nervously thanked him for the gift  the next requirement of man continued the demon is defense from his enemies  i notice with sorrow that men frequently have wars and kill one another  also even in civilized communities man is in constant danger from highwaymen cranks and policemen  to defend himself he uses heavy and dangerous guns with which to destroy his enemies  this is wrong  he has no right to take away what he can not bestow to destroy what he can not create  to kill a fellow-creature is a horrid crime even if done in self-defense  therefore my second gift to you is this little tube  you may carry it within your pocket whenever an enemy threatens you be it man or beast simply point the tube and press this button in the handle  an electric current will instantly be directed upon your foe rendering him wholly unconscious for the period of one hour  during that time you will have opportunity to escape  as for your enemy after regaining consciousness he will suffer no inconvenience from the encounter beyond a slight headache  that's fine said rob as he took the tube  it was scarcely six inches long and hollow at one end  the busy lives of men proceeded the demon require them to move about and travel in all directions  yet to assist them there are only such crude and awkward machines as electric trolleys cable cars steam railways and automobiles  these crawl slowly over the uneven surface of the earth and frequently get out of order  it has grieved me that men have not yet discovered what even birds know  that the atmosphere offers them swift and easy means of traveling from one part of the earth's surface to another  some people have tried to build airships remarked rob  so they have great unwieldy machines which offer so much resistance to the air that they are quite useless  a big machine is not needed to carry one through the air  there are forces in nature which may be readily used for such purpose  tell me what holds you to the earth and makes a stone fall to the ground  attraction of gravitation said rob promptly  exactly  that is one force i refer to said the demon  the force of repulsion which is little known but just as powerful is another that mankind may direct  then there are the polar electric forces attracting objects toward the north or south poles  you have guessed something of this by the use of the compass or electric needle opposed to these is centrifugal electric force drawing objects from east to west or in the opposite direction  this force is created by the whirl of the earth upon its axis and is easily utilized although your scientific men have as yet paid little attention to it  these forces operating in all directions absolute and immutable are at the disposal of mankind  they will carry you through the atmosphere wherever and whenever you choose  that is if you know how to control them  now here is a machine i have myself perfected  the demon drew from his pocket something that resembled an open-faced watch having a narrow flexible band attached to it  when you wish to travel said he attach this little machine to your left wrist by means of the band  it is very light and will not be in your way  on this dial are points marked 'up' and 'down' as well as a perfect compass  when you desire to rise into the air set the indicator to the word 'up' using a finger of your right hand to turn it  when you have risen as high as you wish set the indicator to the point of the compass you want to follow and you will be carried by the proper electric force in that direction  to descend set the indicator to the word 'down'  do you understand  perfectly cried rob taking the machine from the demon with unfeigned delight  this is really wonderful and i'm awfully obliged to you  don't mention it returned the demon dryly  these three gifts you may amuse yourself with for the next week  it seems hard to entrust such great scientific discoveries to the discretion of a mere boy but they are quite harmless so if you exercise proper care you can not get into trouble through their possession  and who knows what benefits to humanity may result  one week from to-day at this hour i will again appear to you at which time you shall receive the second series of electrical gifts  i'm not sure said rob that i shall be able again to make the connections that will strike the master key  probably not answered the demon  could you accomplish that you might command my services forever  but having once succeeded you are entitled to the nine gifts three each week for three weeks so you have no need to call me to do my duty  i shall appear of my own accord  thank you murmured the boy  the demon bowed and spread his hands in the form of a semi-circle  an instant later there was a blinding flash and when rob recovered from it and opened his eyes the demon of electricity had disappeared     4  testing the instruments   there is little doubt that this strange experience befallen a grown man he would have been stricken with a fit of trembling or a sense of apprehension or even fear at the thought of having faced the terrible demon of electricity of having struck the master key of the world's greatest natural forces and finding himself possessed of three such wonderful and useful gifts  but a boy takes everything as a matter of course  as the tree of knowledge sprouts and expands within him shooting out leaf after leaf of practical experience the succession of surprises dulls his faculty of wonderment  it takes a great deal to startle a boy  rob was full of delight at his unexpected good fortune but he did not stop to consider that there was anything remarkably queer or uncanny in the manner in which it had come to him  his chief sensation was one of pride  he would now be able to surprise those who had made fun of his electrical craze and force them to respect his marvelous powers  he decided to say nothing about the demon or the accidental striking of the master key  in exhibiting to his friends the electrical devices he had acquired it would be no end of fun to mark their amazement and leave them to guess how he performed his feats  so he put his treasures into his pocket locked his workshop and went downstairs to his room to prepare for dinner  while brushing his hair he remembered it was no longer necessary for him to eat ordinary food  he was feeling quite hungry at that moment for he had a boy's ravenous appetite but taking the silver box from his pocket he swallowed a tablet and at once felt his hunger as fully satisfied as if he had partaken of a hearty meal while at the same time he experienced an exhilarating glow throughout his body and a clearness of brain and gaiety of spirits which filled him with intense gratification  still he entered the dining-room when the bell rang and found his father and mother and sisters already assembled there  where have you been all day robert inquired his mother  no need to ask said mr joslyn with a laugh  fussing over electricity i'll bet a cookie  i do wish said the mother fretfully that he would get over that mania  it unfits him for anything else  precisely returned her husband dishing the soup but it fits him for a great career when he becomes a man  why shouldn't he spend his summer vacation in pursuit of useful knowledge instead of romping around like ordinary boys  no soup thank you said rob  what exclaimed his father looking at him in surprise it's your favorite soup  i know said rob quietly but i don't want any  are you ill robert asked his mother  never felt better in my life answered rob truthfully  yet mrs joslyn looked worried and when rob refused the roast she was really shocked  let me feel your pulse my poor boy she commanded and wondered to find it so regular  in fact rob's action surprised them all  he sat calmly throughout the meal eating nothing but apparently in good health and spirits while even his sisters regarded him with troubled countenances  he's worked too hard i guess said mr joslyn shaking his head sadly  oh no i haven't protested rob but i've decided not to eat anything hereafter  it's a bad habit and does more harm than good  wait till breakfast said sister helen with a laugh you'll be hungry enough by that time  however the boy had no desire for food at breakfast time either as the tablet sufficed for an entire day  so he renewed the anxiety of the family by refusing to join them at the table  if this goes on mr joslyn said to his son when breakfast was finished i shall be obliged to send you away for your health  i think of making a trip this morning said rob carelessly  where to  oh i may go to boston or take a run over to cuba or jamaica replied the boy  but you can not go so far by yourself declared his father and there is no one to go with you just now  nor can i spare the money at present for so expensive a trip  oh it won't cost anything replied rob with a smile  mr joslyn looked upon him gravely and sighed  mrs joslyn bent over her son with tears in her eyes and said   this electrical nonsense has affected your mind dear  you must promise me to keep away from that horrid workshop for a time  i won't enter it for a week he answered  but you needn't worry about me  i haven't been experimenting with electricity all this time for nothing i can tell you  as for my health i'm as well and strong as any boy need be and there's nothing wrong with my head either common folks always think great men are crazy but edison and tesla and i don't pay any attention to that  we've got our discoveries to look after  now as i said i'm going for a little trip in the interests of science  i may be back to-night or i may be gone several days anyhow i'll be back in a week and you mustn't worry about me a single minute  how are you going inquired his father in the gentle soothing tone persons use in addressing maniacs  through the air said rob  his father groaned  where's your balloon inquired sister mabel sarcastically  i don't need a balloon returned the boy  that's a clumsy way of traveling at best  i shall go by electric propulsion  good gracious cried mr joslyn and the mother murmured  my poor boy my poor boy  as you are my nearest relatives continued rob not noticing these exclamations i will allow you to come into the back yard and see me start  you will then understand something of my electrical powers  they followed him at once although with unbelieving faces and on the way rob clasped the little machine to his left wrist so that his coat sleeve nearly hid it  when they reached the lawn at the back of the house rob kissed them all good-by much to his sisters' amusement and turned the indicator of the little instrument to the word up  immediately he began to rise into the air  don't worry about me he called down to them  good-by  mrs joslyn with a scream of terror hid her face in her hands  he'll break his neck cried the astounded father tipping back his head to look after his departing son  come back  come back shouted the girls to the soaring adventurer  i will some day was the far-away answer  having risen high enough to pass over the tallest tree or steeple rob put the indicator to the east of the compass-dial and at once began moving rapidly in that direction  the sensation was delightful  he rode as gently as a feather floats without any exertion at all on his own part yet he moved so swiftly that he easily distanced a railway train that was speeding in the same direction  this is great reflected the youth  here i am traveling in fine style without a penny to pay any one  and i've enough food to last me a month in my coat pocket  this electricity is the proper stuff after all  and the demon's a trump and no mistake  whee-ee  how small everything looks down below there  the people are bugs and the houses are soap-boxes and the trees are like clumps of grass  i seem to be passing over a town  guess i'll drop down a bit and take in the sights  he pointed the indicator to the word down and at once began dropping through the air  he experienced the sensation one feels while descending in an elevator  when he reached a point just above the town he put the indicator to the zero mark and remained stationary while he examined the place  but there was nothing to interest him particularly so after a brief survey he once more ascended and continued his journey toward the east  at about two o'clock in the afternoon he reached the city of boston and alighting unobserved in a quiet street he walked around for several hours enjoying the sights and wondering what people would think of him if they but knew his remarkable powers  but as he looked just like any other boy no one noticed him in any way  it was nearly evening and rob had wandered down by the wharves to look at the shipping when his attention was called to an ugly looking bull dog which ran toward him and began barking ferociously  get out said the boy carelessly and made a kick at the brute  the dog uttered a fierce growl and sprang upon him with bared teeth and flashing red eyes  instantly rob drew the electric tube from his pocket pointed it at the dog and pressed the button  almost at the same moment the dog gave a yelp rolled over once or twice and lay still  i guess that'll settle him laughed the boy but just then he heard an angry shout and looking around saw a policeman running toward him  kill me dog will ye eh yelled the officer well i'll just run ye in for that same an' ye'll spend the night in the lockup and on he came with drawn club in one hand and a big revolver in the other  you'll have to catch me first said rob still laughing and to the amazement of the policeman he began rising straight into the air  come down here  come down or i'll shoot shouted the fellow flourishing his revolver  rob was afraid he would so to avoid accidents he pointed the tube at him and pressed the button  the red-whiskered policeman keeled over quite gracefully and fell across the body of the dog while rob continued to mount upward until he was out of sight of those in the streets  that was a narrow escape he thought breathing more freely  i hated to paralyze that policeman but he might have sent a bullet after me  anyhow he'll be all right again in an hour so i needn't worry  it was beginning to grow dark and he wondered what he should do next had he possessed any money he would have descended to the town and taken a bed at a hotel but he had left home without a single penny fortunately the nights were warm at this season so he determined to travel all night that he might reach by morning some place he had never before visited  cuba had always interested him and he judged it ought to lie in a southeasterly direction from boston  so he set the indicator to that point and began gliding swiftly toward the southeast  he now remembered that it was twenty-four hours since he had eaten the first electrical tablet  as he rode through the air he consumed another  all hunger at once left him while he felt the same invigorating sensations as before  after a time the moon came out and rob amused himself gazing at the countless stars in the sky and wondering if the demon was right when he said the world was the most important of all the planets  but presently he grew sleepy and before he realized what was happening he had fallen into a sound and peaceful slumber while the indicator still pointed to the southeast and he continued to move rapidly through the cool night air     5  the cannibal island   doubtless the adventures of the day had tired rob for he slept throughout the night as comfortably as if he had been within his own room lying upon his own bed  when at last he opened his eyes and gazed sleepily about him he found himself over a great body of water moving along with considerable speed  it's the ocean of course he said to himself  i haven't reached cuba yet  it is to be regretted that rob's knowledge of geography was so superficial for as he had intended to reach cuba he should have taken a course almost southwest from boston instead of southeast  the sad result of his ignorance you will presently learn for during the entire day he continued to travel over a boundless waste of ocean without the sight of even an island to cheer him  the sun shone so hot that he regretted he had not brought an umbrella but he wore a wide-brimmed straw hat which protected him somewhat and he finally discovered that by rising to a considerable distance above the ocean he avoided the reflection of the sun upon the water and also came with the current of good breeze  of course he dared no stop for there was no place to land so he calmly continued his journey  it may be i've missed cuba he thought but i can not change my course now for if i did i might get lost and never be able to find land again  if i keep on as i am i shall be sure to reach land of some sort in time and when i wish to return home i can set the indicator to the northwest and that will take me directly back to boston  this was good reasoning but the rash youth had no idea he was speeding over the ocean or that he was destined to arrive shortly at the barbarous island of brava off the coast of africa  yet such was the case just as the sun sank over the edge of the waves he saw to his great relief a large island directly in his path  he dropped to a lower position in the air and when he judged himself to be over the center of the island he turned the indicator to zero and stopped short  the country was beautifully wooded while pretty brooks sparkled through the rich green foliage of the trees  the island sloped upwards from the sea-coast in all directions rising to a hill that was almost a mountain in the center  there were two open spaces one on each side of the island and rob saw that these spaces were occupied by queer-looking huts built from brushwood and branches of trees  this showed that the island was inhabited but as rob had no idea what island it was he wisely determined not to meet the natives until he had discovered what they were like and whether they were disposed to be friendly  so he moved over the hill the top of which proved to be a flat grass-covered plateau about fifty feet in diameter  finding it could not be easily reached from below on account of its steep sides and contained neither men nor animals he alighted on the hill-top and touched his feet to the earth for the first time in twenty-four hours  the ride through the air had not tired him in the least in fact he felt as fresh and vigorous as if he had been resting throughout the journey  as he walked upon the soft grass of the plateau he felt elated and compared himself to the explorers of ancient days for it was evident that civilization had not yet reached this delightful spot  there was scarcely any twilight in this tropical climate and it grew dark quickly  within a few minutes the entire island save where he stood became dim and indistinct  he ate his daily tablet and after watching the red glow fade in the western sky and the gray shadows of night settle around him he stretched himself comfortably upon the grass and went to sleep  the events of the day must have deepened his slumber for when he awoke the sun was shining almost directly over him showing that the day was well advanced  he stood up rubbed the sleep from his eyes and decided he would like a drink of water  from where he stood he could see several little brooks following winding paths through the forest so he settled upon one that seemed farthest from the brushwood villages and turning his indicator in that direction soon floated through the air to a sheltered spot upon the bank  kneeling down he enjoyed a long refreshing drink of the clear water but as he started to regain his feet a coil of rope was suddenly thrown about him pinning his arms to his sides and rendering him absolutely helpless  at the same time his ears were saluted with a wild chattering in an unknown tongue and he found himself surrounded by a group of natives of hideous appearance  they were nearly naked and bore spears and heavy clubs as their only weapons  their hair was long curly and thick as bushes and through their noses and ears were stuck the teeth of sharks and curious metal ornaments  these creatures had stolen upon rob so quietly that he had not heard a sound but now they jabbered loudly as if much excited  finally one fat and somewhat aged native who seemed to be a chief came close to rob and said in broken english   how get here  i flew said the boy with a grin  the chief shook his head saying   no boat come  how white man come  through the air replied rob who was rather flattered at being called a man  the chief looked into the air with a puzzled expression and shook his head again  white man lie he said calmly  then he held further conversation with his fellows after which he turned to rob and announced   me see white man many times  come in big boats  white man all bad make kill with bang-sticks  we kill white man with club  then we eat white man  dead white man good  live white man bad  this did not please rob at all  the idea of being eaten by savages had never occurred to him as a sequel to his adventures  so he said rather anxiously to the chief  look here old fellow do you want to die  me no die  you die was the reply  you'll die too if you eat me said rob  i'm full of poison  poison  don't know poison returned the chief much perplexed to understand him  well poison will make you sick awful sick  then you'll die  i'm full of it eat it every day for breakfast  it don't hurt white men you see but it kills black men quicker than the bang-stick  the chief listened to this statement carefully but only understood it in part  after a moment's reflection he declared   white man lie  lie all time  me eat plenty white man  never get sick never die  then he added with renewed cheerfulness  me eat you too  before rob could think of a further protest his captors caught up the end of the rope and led him away through the forest  he was tightly bound and one strand of rope ran across the machine on his wrist and pressed it into his flesh until the pain was severe  but he resolved to be brave whatever happened so he stumbled along after the savages without a word  after a brief journey they came to a village where rob was thrust into a brushwood hut and thrown upon the ground still tightly bound  we light fire said the chief  then kill little white man  then eat him  with this comforting promise he went away and left rob alone to think the matter over  this is tough reflected the boy with a groan  i never expected to feed cannibals  wish i was at home with mother and dad and the girls wish i'd never seen the demon of electricity and his wonderful inventions  i was happy enough before i struck that awful master key and now i'll be eaten with salt and pepper probably  wonder if there'll be any gravy  perhaps they'll boil me with biscuits as mother does chickens  oh-h-h-h-h  it's just awful  in the midst of these depressing thoughts he became aware that something was hurting his back  after rolling over he found that he had been lying upon a sharp stone that stuck out of the earth  this gave him an idea  he rolled upon the stone again and began rubbing the rope that bound him against the sharp edge  outside he could hear the crackling of fagots and the roar of a newly-kindled fire so he knew he had no time to spare  he wriggled and pushed his body right and left right and left sawing away at the rope until the strain and exertion started the perspiration from every pore  at length the rope parted and hastily uncoiling it from his body rob stood up and rubbed his benumbed muscles and tried to regain his lost breath  he had not freed himself a moment too soon he found for hearing a grunt of surprise behind him he turned around and saw a native standing in the door of the hut  rob laughed for he was not a bit afraid of the blacks now  as the native made a rush toward him the boy drew the electric tube from his pocket pointed it at the foe and pressed the button  the fellow sank to the earth without even a groan and lay still  then another black entered followed by the fat chief  when they saw rob at liberty and their comrade lying apparently dead the chief cried out in surprise using some expressive words in his own language  if it's just the same to you old chap said rob coolly i won't be eaten to-day  you can make a pie of that fellow on the ground  no  we eat you cried the chief angrily  you cut rope but no get away no boat  i don't need a boat thank you said the boy and then as the other native sprang forward he pointed the tube and laid him out beside his first victim  at this act the chief stood an instant in amazed uncertainty  then he turned and rushed from the hut  laughing with amusement at the waddling fat figure rob followed the chief and found himself standing almost in the center of the native village  a big fire was blazing merrily and the blacks were busy making preparations for a grand feast  rob was quickly surrounded by a crowd of the villagers who chattered fiercely and made threatening motions in his direction but as the chief cried out to them a warning in the native tongue they kept a respectful distance and contented themselves with brandishing their spears and clubs  if any of your fellows come nearer rob said to the fat chief i'll knock 'em over  what you make do asked the chief nervously  watch sharp and you'll see answered rob  then he made a mocking bow to the circle and continued  i'm pleased to have met you fellows and proud to think you like me well enough to want to eat me but i'm in a bit of a hurry to-day so i can't stop to be digested  after which as the crowd broke into a hum of surprise he added  good-day black folks and quickly turned the indicator of his traveling machine to the word up  slowly he rose into the air until his heels were just above the gaping blacks but there he stopped short  with a thrill of fear he glanced at the indicator  it was pointed properly and he knew at once that something was wrong with the delicate mechanism that controlled it probably the pressure of the rope across its face when he was bound had put it out of order  there he was seven feet in the air but without the power to rise an inch farther  this short flight however had greatly astonished the blacks who seeing his body suspended in mid-air immediately hailed him as a god and prostrated themselves upon the ground before him  the fat chief had seen something of white men in his youth and had learned to mistrust them  so while he remained as prostrate as the rest he peeped at rob with one of his little black eyes and saw that the boy was ill at ease and seemed both annoyed and frightened  so he muttered some orders to the man next him who wriggled along the ground until he had reached a position behind rob when he rose and pricked the suspended god with the point of his spear  ouch yelled the boy stop that  he twisted his head around and seeing the black again make a movement with the spear rob turned his electric tube upon him and keeled him over like a ten-pin  the natives who had looked up at his cry of pain again prostrated themselves kicking their toes against the ground in a terrified tattoo at this new evidence of the god's powers  the situation was growing somewhat strained by this time and rob did not know what the savages would decide to do next so he thought it best to move away from them since he was unable to rise to a greater height  he turned the indicator towards the south where a level space appeared between the trees but instead of taking that direction he moved towards the northeast a proof that his machine had now become absolutely unreliable  moreover he was slowly approaching the fire which although it had ceased blazing was a mass of glowing red embers  in his excitement he turned the indicator this way and that trying to change the direction of his flight but the only result of his endeavor was to carry him directly over the fire where he came to a full stop  murder  help  fire and blazes he cried as he felt the glow of the coals beneath him  i'll be roasted after all  here help fatty help  the fat chief sprang to his feet and came to the rescue  he reached up caught rob by the heels and pulled him down to the ground away from the fire  but the next moment as he clung to the boy's feet they both soared into the air again and although now far enough from the fire to escape its heat the savage finding himself lifted from the earth uttered a scream of horror and let go of rob to fall head over heels upon the ground  the other blacks had by this time regained their feet and now they crowded around their chief and set him upright again  rob continued to float in the air just above their heads and now abandoned all thoughts of escaping by means of his wrecked traveling machine  but he resolved to regain a foothold upon the earth and take his chances of escape by running rather than flying  so he turned the indicator to the word down and very slowly it obeyed allowing him to his great relief to sink gently to the ground     6  the buccaneers   once more the blacks formed a circle around our adventurer who coolly drew his tube and said to the chief   tell your people i'm going to walk away through those trees and if any one dares to interfere with me i'll paralyze him  the chief understood enough english to catch his meaning and repeated the message to his men  having seen the terrible effect of the electric tube they wisely fell back and allowed the boy to pass  he marched through their lines with a fine air of dignity although he was fearful lest some of the blacks should stick a spear into him or bump his head with a war-club  but they were awed by the wonders they had seen and were still inclined to believe him a god so he was not molested  when he found himself outside the village he made for the high plateau in the center of the island where he could be safe from the cannibals while he collected his thoughts  but when he reached the place he found the sides so steep he could not climb them so he adjusted the indicator to the word up and found it had still had enough power to support his body while he clambered up the rocks to the level grass-covered space at the top  then reclining upon his back he gave himself up to thoughts of how he might escape from his unpleasant predicament  here i am on a cannibal island hundreds of miles from civilization with no way to get back he reflected  the family will look for me every day and finally decide i've broken my neck  the demon will call upon me when the week is up and won't find me at home so i'll miss the next three gifts  i don't mind that so much for they might bring me into worst scrapes than this  but how am i to get away from this beastly island  i'll be eaten after all if i don't look out  these and similar thoughts occupied him for some time yet in spite of much planning and thinking he could find no practical means of escape  at the end of an hour he looked over the edge of the plateau and found it surrounded by a ring of the black cannibals who had calmly seated themselves to watch his movements  perhaps they intend to starve me into surrender he thought but they won't succeed so long as my tablets hold out  and if in time they should starve me i'll be too thin and tough to make good eating so i'll get the best of them anyhow  then he again lay down and began to examine his electrical traveling machine  he did not dare take it apart fearing he might not be able to get it together again for he knew nothing at all about its construction  but he discovered two little dents on the edge one on each side which had evidently been caused by the pressure of the rope  if i could get those dents out he thought the machine might work  he first tried to pry out the edges with his pocket knife but the attempt resulted in failure  then as the sides seemed a little bulged outward by the dents he placed the machine between two flat stones and pressed them together until the little instrument was nearly round again  the dents remained to be sure but he hoped he had removed the pressure upon the works  there was just one way to discover how well he had succeeded so he fastened the machine to his wrist and turned the indicator to the word up  slowly he ascended this time to a height of nearly twenty feet  then his progress became slower and finally ceased altogether  that's a little better he thought  now let's see if it will go sidewise  he put the indicator to north-west the direction of home and very slowly the machine obeyed and carried him away from the plateau and across the island  the natives saw him go and springing to their feet began uttering excited shouts and throwing their spears at him  but he was already so high and so far away that they failed to reach him and the boy continued his journey unharmed  once the branches of a tall tree caught him and nearly tipped him over but he managed to escape others by drawing up his feet  at last he was free of the island and traveling over the ocean again  he was not at all sorry to bid good-by to the cannibal island but he was worried about the machine which clearly was not in good working order  the vast ocean was beneath him and he moved no faster than an ordinary walk  at this rate i'll get home some time next year  he grumbled however i suppose i ought to be glad the machine works at all  and he really was glad  all the afternoon and all the long summer night he moved slowly over the water  it was annoying to go at a reg'lar jog-trot as rob called it after his former swift flight but there was no help for it  just as dawn was breaking he saw in the distance a small vessel sailing in the direction he was following yet scarcely moving for lack of wind  he soon caught up with it but saw no one on deck and the craft had a dingy and uncared-for appearance that was not reassuring but after hovering over it for some time rob decided to board the ship and rest for a while  he alighted near the bow where the deck was highest and was about to explore the place when a man came out of the low cabin and espied him  this person had a most villainous countenance and was dark-skinned black-bearded and dressed in an outlandish piratical costume  on seeing the boy he gave a loud shout and was immediately joined by four companions each as disagreeable in appearance as the first  rob knew there would be trouble the moment he looked at this evil crew and when they drew their daggers and pistols and began fiercely shouting in an unknown tongue the boy sighed and took the electric tube from his coat pocket  the buccaneers did not notice the movement but rushed upon him so quickly that he had to press the button at a lively rate  the tube made no noise at all so it was a strange and remarkable sight to see the pirates suddenly drop to the deck and lie motionless  indeed one was so nearly upon him when the electric current struck him that his head in falling bumped into rob's stomach and sent him reeling against the side of the vessel  he quickly recovered himself and seeing his enemies were rendered harmless the boy entered the cabin and examined it curiously  it was dirty and ill-smelling enough but the corners and spare berths were heaped with merchandise of all kinds which had been taken from those so unlucky as to have met these cruel and desperate men  after a short inspection of the place he returned to the deck and again seated himself in the bow  the crippled condition of his traveling machine was now his chief trouble and although a good breeze had sprung up to fill the sails and the little bark was making fair headway rob knew he could never expect to reach home unless he could discover a better mode of conveyance than this  he unstrapped the machine from his wrist to examine it better and while holding it carelessly in his hand it slipped and fell with a bang to the deck striking upon its round edge and rolling quickly past the cabin and out of sight  with a cry of alarm he ran after it and after much search found it lying against the bulwark near the edge of a scupper hole where the least jar of the ship would have sent it to the bottom of the ocean  rob hastily seized his treasure and upon examining it found the fall had bulged the rim so that the old dents scarcely showed at all  but its original shape was more distorted than ever and rob feared he had utterly ruined its delicate mechanism should this prove to be true he might now consider himself a prisoner of this piratical band the members of which although temporarily disabled would soon regain consciousness  he sat in the bow sadly thinking of his misfortunes until he noticed that one of the men began to stir  the effect of the electric shock conveyed by the tube was beginning to wear away and now the buccaneer sat up rubbed his head in a bewildered fashion and looked around him when he saw rob he gave a shout of rage and drew his knife but one motion of the electric tube made him cringe and slip away to the cabin where he remained out of danger  and now the other four sat up groaning and muttering in their outlandish speech  but they had no notion of facing rob's tube a second time so one by one they joined their leader in the cabin leaving the boy undisturbed  by this time the ship had begun to pitch and toss in an uncomfortable fashion and rob noticed that the breeze had increased to a gale there being no one to look after the sails the vessel was in grave danger of capsizing or breaking her masts  the waves were now running high too and rob began to be worried  presently the captain of the pirates stuck his head out of the cabin door jabbered some unintelligible words and pointed to the sails  the boy nodded for he understood they wanted to attend to the rigging  so the crew trooped forth rather fearfully and began to reef the sails and put the ship into condition to weather the storm  rob paid no further attention to them  he looked at his traveling machine rather doubtfully and wondered if he dared risk its power to carry him through the air  whether he remained in the ship or trusted to the machine he stood a good chance of dropping into the sea at any moment  so while he hesitated he attached the machine to his wrist and leaned over the bulwarks to watch the progress of the storm  he might stay in the ship until it foundered he thought and then take his chances with the machine  he decided to wait until a climax arrived  the climax came the next moment for while he leaned over the bulwarks the buccaneers stole up behind him and suddenly seized him in their grasp  while two of them held his arms the others searched his pockets taking from him the electric tube and the silver box containing his tablets  these they carried to the cabin and threw upon the heap of other valuables they had stolen  they did not notice his traveling machine however but seeing him now unarmed they began jeering and laughing at him while the brutal captain relieved his anger by giving the prisoner several malicious kicks  rob bore his misfortune meekly although he was almost ready to cry with grief and disappointment  but when one of the pirates to inflict further punishment on the boy came towards him with a heavy strap he resolved not to await the blow  turning the indicator to the word up he found to his joy and relief that it would yet obey the influence of the power of repulsion  seeing him rise into the air the fellow made a grab for his foot and held it firmly while his companions ran to help him  weight seemed to make no difference in the machine it lifted the pirate as well as rob it lifted another who clung to the first man's leg and another who clung to him  the other two also caught hold hoping their united strength would pull him down and the next minute rob was soaring through the air with the entire string of five buccaneers dangling from his left leg  at first the villains were too astounded to speak but as they realized that they were being carried through the air and away from their ship they broke into loud shouts of dismay and finally the one who grasped rob's leg lost his hold and the five plunged downward and splashed into the sea  finding the machine disposed to work accurately rob left the buccaneers to swim to the ship in the best way they could while he dropped down to the deck again and recovered from the cabin his box of tablets and the electric tube  the fellows were just scrambling on board when he again escaped shooting into the air with considerable speed  indeed the instrument now worked better than at any time since he had reached the cannibal island and the boy was greatly delighted  the wind at first sent him spinning away to the south but he continued to rise until he was above the air currents and the storm raged far beneath him  then he set the indicator to the northwest and breathlessly waited to see if it would obey  hurrah away he sped at a fair rate of speed while all his anxiety changed to a feeling of sweet contentment  his success had greatly surprised him but he concluded that the jar caused by dropping the instrument had relieved the pressure upon the works and so helped rather than harmed the free action of the electric currents  while he moved through the air with an easy gliding motion he watched with much interest the storm raging below  above his head the sun was peacefully shining and the contrast was strange and impressive  after an hour or so the storm abated or else he passed away from it for the deep blue of the ocean again greeted his eyes  he dropped downward until he was about a hundred feet above the water when he continued his northwesterly course  but now he regretted having interfered for a moment with the action of the machine for his progress instead of being swift as a bird's flight became slow and jerky nor was he sure that the damaged machine might not break down altogether at any moment  yet so far his progress was in the right direction and he resolved to experiment no further with the instrument but to let it go as it would so long as it supported him above the water  however irregular the motion might be it was sure if continued to bring him to land in time and that was all he cared about just then  when night fell his slumber was broken and uneasy for he wakened more than once with a start of fear that the machine had broken and he was falling into the sea  sometimes he was carried along at a swift pace and again the machine scarcely worked at all so his anxiety was excusable  the following day was one of continued uneasiness for the boy who began to be harrassed by doubts as to whether after all he was moving in the right direction  the machine had failed at one time in this respect and it might again  he had lost all confidence in its accuracy  in spite of these perplexities rob passed the second night of his uneven flight in profound slumber being exhausted by the strain and excitement he had undergone  when he awoke at daybreak he saw to his profound delight that he was approaching land  the rising sun found him passing over a big city which he knew to be boston  he did not stop  the machine was so little to be depended upon that he dared make no halt  but he was obliged to alter the direction from northwest to west and the result of this slight change was so great a reduction in speed that it was mid-day before he saw beneath him the familiar village in which he lived  carefully marking the location of his father's house he came to a stop directly over it and a few moments later he managed to land upon the exact spot in the back yard whence he had taken his first successful flight     7  the demon becomes angry   when rob had been hugged and kissed by his mother and sisters and even mr joslyn had embraced him warmly he gave them a brief account of his adventures  the story was received with many doubtful looks and much grave shaking of heads as was quite natural under the circumstances  i hope my dear son said the father that you have now passed through enough dangers to last you a lifetime so that hereafter you will be contented to remain at home  oh robert cried his mother with tears in her loving eyes you don't know how we've all worried about you for the past week  a week asked rob with surprise  yes it's a week to-morrow morning since you flew into the air and disappeared  then said the boy thoughtfully i've reached home just in time  in time for what she asked  but he did not answer that question  he was thinking of the demon and that on the afternoon of this very day he might expect the wise and splendid genius to visit him a second time  at luncheon although he did not feel hungry he joined the family at the table and pleased his mother by eating as heartily as of old  he was surprised to find how good the food tasted and to realize what a pleasure it is to gratify one's sense of taste  the tablets were all right for a journey he thought but if he always ate them he would be sure to miss a great deal of enjoyment since there was no taste to them at all  at four o'clock he went to his workshop and unlocked the door everything was exactly as he had left it and he looked at his simple electrical devices with some amusement  they seemed tame beside the wonders now in his possession yet he recollected that his numerous wires had enabled him to strike the master key and therefore should not be despised  before long he noticed a quickening in the air as if it were suddenly surcharged with electric fluid and the next instant in a dazzling flash of light appeared the demon  i am here he announced  so am i answered rob  but at one time i really thought i should never see you again  i've been   spare me your history said the demon coldly  i am aware of your adventures  oh you are said rob amazed  then you know   i know all about your foolish experiences interrupted the demon for i have been with you constantly although i remained invisible  then you know what a jolly time i've had returned the boy  but why do you call them foolish experiences  because they were abominably foolish retorted the demon bitterly i entrusted to you gifts of rare scientific interest electrical devices of such utility that their general adoption by mankind would create a new era in earth life  i hoped your use of these devices would convey such hints to electrical engineers that they would quickly comprehend their mechanism and be able to reproduce them in sufficient quantities to supply the world  and how do you treat these marvelous gifts  why you carry them to a cannibal island where even your crude civilization has not yet penetrated  i wanted to astonish the natives said rob grinning  the demon uttered an exclamation of anger and stamped his foot so fiercely that thousands of electric sparks filled the air to disappear quickly with a hissing crinkling sound  you might have astonished those ignorant natives as easily by showing them an ordinary electric light he cried mockingly  the power of your gifts would have startled the most advanced electricians of the world  why did you waste them upon barbarians  really faltered rob who was frightened and awed by the demon's vehement anger i never intended to visit a cannibal island  i meant to go to cuba  cuba  is that a center of advanced scientific thought  why did you not take your marvels to new york or chicago or if you wished to cross the ocean to paris or vienna  i never thought of those places acknowledged rob meekly  then you were foolish as i said declared the demon in a calmer tone  can you not realize that it is better to be considered great by the intelligent thinkers of the earth than to be taken for a god by stupid cannibals  oh yes of course said rob  i wish now that i had gone to europe but you're not the only one who has a kick coming he continued your flimsy traveling machine was nearly the death of me  ah it is true acknowledged the demon frankly  the case was made of too light material  when the rim was bent it pressed against the works and impeded the proper action of the currents  had you gone to a civilized country such an accident could not have happened but to avoid possible trouble in the future i have prepared a new instrument having a stronger case which i will exchange for the one you now have  that's very kind of you said rob eagerly handing his battered machine to the demon and receiving the new one in return  are you sure this will work  it is impossible for you to injure it answered the other  and how about the next three gifts inquired the boy anxiously  before i grant them replied the demon you must give me a promise to keep away from uncivilized places and to exhibit your acquirements only among people of intelligence  all right agreed the boy i'm not anxious to visit that island again or any other uncivilized country  then i will add to your possessions three gifts each more precious and important than the three you have already received  at this announcement rob began to quiver with excitement and sat staring eagerly at the demon while the latter increased in stature and sparkled and glowed more brilliantly than ever     8  rob acquires new powers   i have seen the folly of sending you into the world with an offensive instrument yet with no method of defense resumed the demon presently  you have knocked over a good many people with that tube during the past week  i know said rob but i couldn't help it  it was the only way i had to protect myself  therefore my next gift shall be this garment of protection  you must wear it underneath your clothing  it has power to accumulate and exercise electrical repellent force  perhaps you do not know what that means so i will explain more fully  when any missile such as a bullet sword or lance approaches your person its rush through the air will arouse the repellent force of which i speak and this force being more powerful than the projective force will arrest the flight of the missile and throw it back again  therefore nothing can touch your person that comes with any degree of force or swiftness and you will be safe from all ordinary weapons  when wearing this garment you will find it unnecessary to use the electric tube except on rare occasions  never allow revenge or animosity to influence your conduct men may threaten but they can not injure you so you must remember that they do not possess your mighty advantages and that because of your strength you should bear with them patiently  rob examined the garment with much curiosity  it glittered like silver yet was soft and pliable as lamb's wool  evidently the demon had prepared it especially for his use for it was just rob's size  now continued the demon more gravely we approach the subject of an electrical device so truly marvelous that even i am awed when i contemplate the accuracy and perfection of the natural laws which guide it and permit it to exercise its functions  mankind has as yet conceived nothing like it for it requires full knowledge of electrical power to understand even its possibilities  the being paused and drew from an inner pocket something resembling a flat metal box  in size it was about four inches by six and nearly an inch in thickness  what is it asked rob wonderingly  it is an automatic record of events answered the demon  i don't understand said rob with hesitation  i will explain to you its use returned the demon although the electrical forces which operate it and the vibratory currents which are the true records must remain unknown to you until your brain has mastered the higher knowledge of electricity  at present the practical side of this invention will be more interesting to you than a review of its scientific construction  suppose you wish to know the principal events that are occurring in germany at the present moment  you first turn this little wheel at the side until the word 'germany' appears in the slot at the small end then open the top cover which is hinged and those passing events in which you are interested will appear before your eyes  the demon as he spoke opened the cover and looking within the boy saw as in a mirror a moving picture before him  a regiment of soldiers was marching through the streets of berlin and at its head rode a body of horsemen in the midst of which was the emperor himself the people who thronged the sidewalks cheered and waved their hats and handkerchiefs with enthusiasm while a band of musicians played a german air which rob could distinctly hear  while he gazed spell-bound the scene changed and he looked upon a great warship entering a harbor with flying pennants  the rails were lined with officers and men straining their eyes for the first sight of their beloved vaterland after a long foreign cruise and a ringing cheer as from a thousand throats came faintly to rob's ear  again the scene changed and within a dingy underground room hemmed in by walls of stone and dimly lighted by a flickering lamp a body of wild-eyed desperate men were plighting an oath to murder the emperor and overthrow his government  anarchists asked rob trembling with excitement  anarchists answered the demon with a faint sneer and he shut the cover of the record with a sudden snap  it's wonderful cried the boy with a sigh that was followed by a slight shiver  the record is indeed proof within itself of the marvelous possibilities of electricity  men are now obliged to depend upon newspapers for information but these can only relate events long after they have occurred  and newspaper statements are often unreliable and sometimes wholly false while many events of real importance are never printed in their columns  you may guess what an improvement is this automatic record of events which is as reliable as truth itself nothing can be altered or falsified for the vibratory currents convey the actual events to your vision even as they happen  but suppose said rob that something important should happen while i'm asleep or not looking at the box  i have called this a record replied the demon and such it really is although i have shown you only such events as are in process of being recorded  by pressing this spring you may open the opposite cover of the box where all events of importance that have occurred throughout the world during the previous twenty-four hours will appear before you in succession  you may thus study them at your leisure the various scenes constitute a register of the world's history and may be recalled to view as often as you desire  it's it's like knowing everything murmured rob deeply impressed for perhaps the first time in his life  it is knowing everything returning the demon and this mighty gift i have decided to entrust to your care  be very careful as to whom you permit to gaze upon these pictures of passing events for knowledge may often cause great misery to the human race  i'll be careful promised the boy as he took the box reverently within his own hands  the third and last gift of the present series resumed the demon is one no less curious than the record of events although it has an entirely different value  it is a character marker  what's that inquired rob  i will explain  perhaps you know that your fellow-creatures are more or less hypocritical  that is they try to appear good when they are not and wise when in reality they are foolish  they tell you they are friendly when they positively hate you and try to make you believe they are kind when their natures are cruel  this hypocrisy seems to be a human failing  one of your writers has said with truth that among civilized people things are seldom what they seem  i've heard that remarked rob  on the other hand continued the demon some people with fierce countenances are kindly by nature and many who appear to be evil are in reality honorable and trustworthy  therefore that you may judge all your fellow-creatures truly and know upon whom to depend i give you the character marker  it consists of this pair of spectacles while you wear them every one you meet will be marked upon the forehead with a letter indicating his or her character  the good will bear the letter 'g' the evil the letter 'e'  the wise will be marked with a 'w' and the foolish with an 'f'  the kind will show a 'k' upon their foreheads and the cruel a letter 'c'  thus you may determine by a single look the true natures of all those you encounter  and are these also electrical in their construction asked the boy as he took the spectacles  certainly  goodness wisdom and kindness are natural forces creating character  for this reason men are not always to blame for bad character as they acquire it unconsciously  all character sends out certain electrical vibrations which these spectacles concentrate in their lenses and exhibit to the gaze of their wearer as i have explained  it's a fine idea said the boy who discovered it  it is a fact that has always existed but is now utilized for the first time  oh said rob  with these gifts and the ones you acquired a week ago you are now equipped to astound the world and awaken mankind to a realization of the wonders that may be accomplished by natural forces  see that you employ these powers wisely in the interests of science and do not forget your promise to exhibit your electrical marvels only to those who are most capable of comprehending them  i'll remember said rob  then adieu until a week from to-day when i will meet you here at this hour and bestow upon you the last three gifts which you are entitled to receive  good-by  good-by repeated rob and in a gorgeous flash of color the demon disappeared leaving the boy alone in the room with his new and wonderful possessions     9  the second journey   by this time you will have gained a fair idea of rob's character  he is in truth a typical american boy possessing an average intelligence not yet regulated by the balance-wheel of experience  the mysteries of electricity were so attractive to his eager nature that he had devoted considerable time and some study to electrical experiment but his study was the superficial kind that seeks to master only such details as may be required at the moment  moreover he was full of boyish recklessness and irresponsibility and therefore difficult to impress with the dignity of science and the gravity of human existence life to him was a great theater wherein he saw himself the most interesting if not the most important actor and so enjoyed the play with unbounded enthusiasm  aside from the extraordinary accident which had forced the electrical demon into this life rob may be considered one of those youngsters who might possibly develop into a brilliant manhood or enter upon an ordinary humdrum existence as fate should determine  just at present he had no thought beyond the passing hour nor would he bother himself by attempting to look ahead or plan for the future  yet the importance of his electrical possessions and the stern injunction of the demon to use them wisely had rendered the boy more thoughtful than at any previous time during his brief life and he became so preoccupied at the dinner table that his father and mother cast many anxious looks in his direction  of course rob was anxious to test his newly-acquired powers and decided to lose no time in starting upon another journey  but he said nothing to any of the family about it fearing to meet with opposition  he passed the evening in the sitting-room in company with his father and mother and sisters and even controlled his impatience to the extent of playing a game of carom with nell but he grew so nervous and impatient at last that his sister gave up the game in disgust and left him to his own amusement  at one time he thought of putting on the electric spectacles and seeing what the real character of each member of his family might be but a sudden fear took possession of him that he might regret the act forever afterward  they were his nearest and dearest friends on earth and in his boyish heart he loved them all and believed in their goodness and sincerity  the possibility of finding a bad character mark on any of their familiar faces made him shudder and he determined then and there never to use the spectacles to view the face of a friend or relative had any one at that moment been gazing at rob through the lenses of the wonderful character marker i am sure a big w would have been found upon the boy's forehead  when the family circle broke up and all retired for the night rob kissed his parents and sisters with real affection before going to his own room  but on reaching his cozy little chamber instead of preparing for bed rob clothed himself in the garment of repulsion then he covered the glittering garment with his best summer suit of clothes which effectually concealed it  he now looked around to see what else he should take and thought of an umbrella a rain-coat a book or two to read during the journey and several things besides but he ended by leaving them all behind  i can't be loaded down with so much truck he decided and i'm going into civilized countries this time where i can get anything i need  however to prevent a recurrence of the mistake he had previously made he tore a map of the world and a map of europe from his geography and folding them up placed them in his pocket  he also took a small compass that had once been a watch-charm and finally the contents of a small iron bank that opened with a combination lock  this represented all his savings amounting to two dollars and seventeen cents in dimes nickles and pennies  it isn't a fortune he thought as he counted it up but i didn't need any money the last trip so perhaps i'll get along somehow  i don't like to tackle dad for more for he might ask questions and try to keep me at home  by the time he had finished his preparations and stowed all his electrical belongings in his various pockets it was nearly midnight and the house was quiet  so rob stole down stairs in his stocking feet and noiselessly opened the back door  it was a beautiful july night and in addition to the light of the full moon the sky was filled with the radiance of countless thousands of brilliant stars  after rob had put on his shoes he unfolded the map which was plainly visible by the starlight and marked the direction he must take to cross the atlantic and reach london his first stopping place  then he consulted his compass put the indicator of his traveling machine to the word up and shot swiftly into the air  when he had reached a sufficient height he placed the indicator to a point north of east and with a steady and remarkably swift flight began his journey  here goes he remarked with a sense of exaltation for another week of adventure  i wonder what'll happen between now and next saturday     10  how rob served a mighty king   the new traveling machine was a distinct improvement over the old one for it carried rob with wonderful speed across the broad atlantic  he fell asleep soon after starting and only wakened when the sun was high in the heavens  but he found himself whirling along at a good rate with the greenish shimmer of the peaceful ocean waves spread beneath him far beyond his range of vision  being in the track of the ocean steamers it was not long before he found himself overtaking a magnificent vessel whose decks were crowded with passengers  he dropped down some distance to enable him to see these people more plainly and while he hovered near he could hear the excited exclamations of the passengers who focused dozens of marine glasses upon his floating form  this inspection somewhat embarrassed him and having no mind to be stared at he put on additional speed and soon left the steamer far behind him  about noon the sky clouded over and rob feared a rainstorm was approaching  so he rose to a point considerably beyond the clouds where the air was thin but remarkably pleasant to inhale and the rays of the sun were not so hot as when reflected by the surface of the water  he could see the dark clouds rolling beneath him like volumes of smoke from a factory chimney and knew the earth was catching a severe shower of rain yet he congratulated himself on his foresight in not being burdened with umbrella or raincoat since his elevated position rendered him secure from rain-clouds  but having cut himself off from the earth there remained nothing to see except the clear sky overhead and the tumbling clouds beneath so he took from his pocket the automatic record of events and watched with breathless interest the incidents occurring in different parts of the world  a big battle was being fought in the philippines and so fiercely was it contested that rob watched its progress for hours with rapt attention  finally a brave rally by the americans sent their foes to the cover of the woods where they scattered in every direction only to form again in a deep valley hidden by high hills  if only i was there thought rob i could show that captain where to find the rebels and capture them  but i guess the philippines are rather out of my way so our soldiers will never know how near they are to a complete victory  the boy also found considerable amusement in watching the course of an insurrection in venezuela where opposing armies of well-armed men preferred to bluster and threaten rather than come to blows  during the evening he found that an important event was madame bernhardt's production of a new play and rob followed it from beginning to end with great enjoyment although he felt a bit guilty at not having purchased a ticket  but it's a crowded house anyway he reflected and i'm not taking up a reserved seat or keeping any one else from seeing the show  so where's the harm  yet it seems to me if these records get to be common as the demon wishes people will all stay at home and see the shows and the poor actors 'll starve to death  the thought made him uneasy and he began for the first time to entertain a doubt of the demon's wisdom in forcing such devices upon humanity  the clouds had now passed away and the moon sent her rays to turn the edges of the waves into glistening showers of jewels  rob closed the lid of the wonderful record of events and soon fell into a deep sleep that held him unconscious for many hours  when he awoke he gave a start of surprise for beneath him was land how long it was since he had left the ocean behind him he could not guess but his first thought was to set the indicator of the traveling machine to zero and to hover over the country until he could determine where he was  this was no easy matter  he saw green fields lakes groves and villages but these might exist in any country  being still at a great elevation he descended gradually until he was about twenty feet from the surface of the earth where he paused near the edge of a small village  at once a crowd of excited people assembled shouting to one another and pointing towards him in wonder  in order to be prepared for emergencies rob had taken the electric tube from his pocket and now as he examined the dress and features of the people below the tube suddenly slipped from his grasp and fell to the ground where one end stuck slantingly into the soft earth  a man rushed eagerly towards it but the next moment he threw up his hands and fell upon his back unconscious  others who ran to assist their fallen comrade quickly tumbled into a heap beside him  it was evident to rob that the tube had fallen in such a position that the button was being pressed continually and a current of electric fluid issued to shock whoever came near  not wishing to injure these people he dropped to the ground and drew the tube from the earth thus releasing the pressure upon the button  but the villagers had now decided that the boy was their enemy and no sooner had he touched the ground than a shower of stones and sticks rained about him  not one reached his body however for the garment of repulsion stopped their flight and returned them to rattle with more or less force against those who had thrown them like regular boomerangs thought rob  to receive their own blows in this fashion seemed so like magic to the simple folk that with roars of fear and pain they ran away in all directions  it's no use stopping here remarked rob regretfully for i've spoiled my welcome by this accident  i think these people are irish by their looks and speech so i must be somewhere in the emerald isle  he consulted his map and decided upon the general direction he should take to reach england after which he again rose into the air and before long was passing over the channel towards the shores of england  either his map or compass or his calculations proved wrong for it was high noon before having changed his direction a half dozen times he came to the great city of london  he saw at a glance that it would never do to drop into the crowded streets unless he wanted to become an object of public curiosity so he looked around for a suitable place to alight  near by was a monstrous church that sent a sharp steeple far into the air  rob examined this spire and saw a narrow opening in the masonry that led to a small room where a chime of bells hung  he crept through the opening and finding a ladder that connected the belfry with a platform below began to descend  there were three ladders and then a winding flight of narrow rickety stairs to be passed before rob finally reached a small room in the body of the church  this room proved to have two doors one connecting with the auditorium and the other letting into a side street  both were locked but rob pointed the electric tube at the outside door and broke the lock in an instant  then he walked into the street as composedly as if he had lived all his life in london  there were plenty of sights to see you may be sure and rob walked around until he was so tired that he was glad to rest upon one of the benches in a beautiful park  here half hidden by the trees he amused himself by looking at the record of events  london's a great town and no mistake he said to himself but let's see what the british are doing in south africa to-day  he turned the cylinder to south africa and opening the lid at once became interested  an english column commanded by a brave but stubborn officer was surrounded by the boer forces and fighting desperately to avoid capture or annihilation  this would be interesting to king edward thought the boy  guess i'll hunt him up and tell him about it  a few steps away stood a policeman  rob approached him and asked   where's the king to-day  the officer looked at him with mingled surprise and suspicion  'is majesty is sojournin' at marlb'ro 'ouse just now was the reply per'aps you wants to make 'im a wissit he continued with lofty sarcasm  that's it exactly said rob  i'm an american and thought while i was in london i'd drop in on his royal highness and say 'hello' to him  the officer chuckled as if much amused  hamericans is bloomin' green he remarked so youse can stand for hamerican right enough  no other wissitors is such blarsted fools but yon's the palace an' i s'pose 'is majesty'll give ye a 'ot reception  thanks i'll look him up said the boy and left the officer convulsed with laughter  he soon knew why  the palace was surrounded by a cordon of the king's own life guards who admitted no one save those who presented proper credentials  there's only one thing to do thought rob and that's to walk straight in as i haven't any friends to give me a regular introduction  so he boldly advanced to the gate where he found himself stopped by crossed carbines and a cry of halt  excuse me said rob i'm in a hurry  he pushed the carbines aside and marched on  the soldiers made thrusts at him with their weapons and an officer jabbed at his breast with a glittering sword but the garment of repulsion protected him from these dangers as well as from a hail of bullets that followed his advancing figure  he reached the entrance of the palace only to face another group of guardsmen and a second order to halt and as these soldiers were over six feet tall and stood shoulder to shoulder rob saw that he could not hope to pass them without using his electric tube  stand aside you fellows he ordered  there was no response  he extended the tube and as he pressed the button described a semi-circle with the instrument  immediately the tall guardsmen toppled over like so many tenpins and rob stepped across their bodies and penetrated to the reception room where a brilliant assemblage awaited in hushed and anxious groups for opportunity to obtain audience with the king  i hope his majesty isn't busy said rob to a solemn-visaged official who confronted him  i want to have a little talk with him  i i ah beg pardon exclaimed the astounded master of ceremonies what name please  oh never mind my name replied rob and pushing the gentleman aside he entered the audience chamber of the great king  king edward was engaged in earnest consultation with one of his ministers and after a look of surprise in rob's direction and a grave bow he bestowed no further attention upon the intruder  but rob was not to be baffled now  your majesty he interrupted i've important news for you  a big fight is taking place in south africa and your soldiers will probably be cut into mince meat  the minister strode towards the boy angrily  explain this intrusion he cried  i have explained  the boers are having a regular killing-bee  here take a look at it yourselves  he drew the record from his pocket and at the movement the minister shrank back as if he suspected it was an infernal machine and might blow his head off but the king stepped quietly to the boy's side and looked into the box when rob threw open the lid  as he comprehended the full wonder of the phenomenon he was observing edward uttered a low cry of amazement but thereafter he silently gazed upon the fierce battle that still raged far away upon the african veld before long his keen eye recognized the troops engaged and realized their imminent danger  they'll be utterly annihilated he gasped  what shall we do  oh we can't do anything just now answered rob  but it's curious to watch how bravely the poor fellows fight for their lives  the minister who by this time was also peering into the box groaned aloud and then all three forgot their surroundings in the tragedy they were beholding  hemmed in by vastly superior numbers the english were calmly and stubbornly resisting every inch of advance and selling their lives as dearly as possible  their leader fell pierced by a hundred bullets and the king who had known him from boyhood passed his hand across his eyes as if to shut out the awful sight  but the fascination of the battle forced him to look again and the next moment he cried aloud   look there  look there  over the edge of a line of hills appeared the helmets of a file of english soldiers  they reached the summit followed by rank after rank until the hillside was alive with them  and then with a ringing cheer that came like a faint echo to the ears of the three watchers they broke into a run and dashed forward to the rescue of their brave comrades  the boers faltered gave back and the next moment fled precipitately while the exhausted survivors of the courageous band fell sobbing into the arms of their rescuers  rob closed the lid of the record with a sudden snap that betrayed his deep feeling and the king pretended to cough behind his handkerchief and stealthily wiped his eyes  'twasn't so bad after all remarked the boy with assumed cheerfulness but it looked mighty ticklish for your men at one time  king edward regarded the boy curiously remembering his abrupt entrance and the marvelous device he had exhibited  what do you call that he asked pointing at the record with a finger that trembled slightly from excitement  it is a new electrical invention replied rob replacing it in his pocket and so constructed that events are reproduced at the exact moment they occur  where can i purchase one demanded the king eagerly  they're not for sale said rob  this one of mine is the first that ever happened  oh  i really think continued the boy nodding sagely that it wouldn't be well to have these records scattered around  their use would give some folks unfair advantage over others you know  certainly  i only showed you this battle because i happened to be in london at the time and thought you'd be interested  it was very kind of you said edward but how did you gain admittance  well to tell the truth i was obliged to knock over a few of your tall life-guards  they seem to think you're a good thing and need looking after like jam in a cupboard  the king smiled  i hope you haven't killed my guards said he  oh no they'll come around all right  it is necessary continued edward that public men be protected from intrusion no matter how democratic they may be personally  you would probably find it as difficult to approach the president of the united states as the king of england  oh i'm not complaining said rob  it wasn't much trouble to break through  you seem quite young to have mastered such wonderful secrets of nature continued the king  so i am replied rob modestly but these natural forces have really existed since the beginning of the world and some one was sure to discover them in time  he was quoting the demon although unconsciously  you are an american i suppose said the minister coming close to rob and staring him in the face  guessed right the first time answered the boy and drawing his character marking spectacles from his pocket he put them on and stared at the minister in turn  upon the man's forehead appeared the letter e  your majesty said rob i have here another queer invention  will you please wear these spectacles for a few moments  the king at once put them on  they are called character markers continued the boy because the lenses catch and concentrate the character vibrations radiating from every human individual and reflect the true character of the person upon his forehead  if a letter 'g' appears you may be sure his disposition is good if his forehead is marked with an 'e' his character is evil and you must beware of treachery  the king saw the e plainly marked upon his minister's forehead but he said nothing except thank you and returned the spectacles to rob  but the minister who from the first had been ill at ease now became positively angry  do not believe him your majesty he cried  it is a trick and meant to deceive you  i did not accuse you answered the king sternly  then he added  i wish to be alone with this young gentleman  the minister left the room with an anxious face and hanging head  now said rob let's look over the record of the past day and see if that fellow has been up to any mischief  he turned the cylinder of the record to england and slowly the events of the last twenty-four hours were reproduced one after the other upon the polished plate  before long the king uttered an exclamation  the record pictured a small room in which were seated three gentlemen engaged in earnest conversation  one of them was the accused minister  those men said the king in a low voice while he pointed out the other two are my avowed enemies  this is proof that your wonderful spectacles indicated my minister's character with perfect truth  i am grateful to you for thus putting me upon my guard for i have trusted the man fully  oh don't mention it replied the boy lightly i'm glad to have been of service to you  but it's time for me to go  i hope you will favor me with another interview said the king for i am much interested in your electrical inventions  i will instruct my guards to admit you at any time so you will not be obliged to fight your way in  all right  but it really doesn't matter answered rob  it's no trouble at all to knock 'em over  then he remembered his manners and bowed low before the king who seemed to him a fine fellow and not a bit stuck up  and then he walked calmly from the palace  the people in the outer room stared at him wonderingly and the officer of the guard saluted the boy respectfully  but rob only smiled in an amused way as he marched past them with his hands thrust deep into his trousers' pockets and his straw hat tipped jauntily upon the back of his head     11  the man of science   rob passed the remainder of the day wandering about london and amusing himself by watching the peculiar ways of the people  when it became so dark that there was no danger of his being observed he rose through the air to the narrow slit in the church tower and lay upon the floor of the little room with the bells hanging all around him to pass the night  he was just falling asleep when a tremendous din and clatter nearly deafened him and set the whole tower trembling  it was the midnight chime  rob clutched his ears tightly and when the vibrations had died away descended by the ladder to a lower platform  but even here the next hourly chime made his ears ring and he kept descending from platform to platform until the last half of a restless night was passed in the little room at the bottom of the tower  when at daylight the boy sat up and rubbed his eyes he said wearily  churches are all right as churches but as hotels they are rank failures  i ought to have bunked in with my friend king edward  he climbed up the stairs and the ladders again and looked out the little window in the belfry  then he examined his map of europe  i believe i'll take a run over to paris he thought  i must be home again by saturday to meet the demon so i'll have to make every day count  without waiting for breakfast since he had eaten a tablet the evening before he crept through the window and mounted into the fresh morning air until the great city with its broad waterway lay spread out beneath him  then he sped away to the southeast and crossing the channel passed between amiens and rouen and reached paris before ten o'clock  near the outskirts of the city appeared a high tower upon the flat roof of which a man was engaged in adjusting a telescope  upon seeing rob who was passing at no great distance from this tower the man cried out   approchez venez ici  then he waved his hands frantically in the air and fairly danced with excitement  so the boy laughed and dropped down to the roof where standing beside the frenchman whose eyes were actually protruding from their sockets he asked coolly   well what do you want  the other was for a moment speechless  he was a tall lean man having a bald head but a thick iron-gray beard and his black eyes sparkled brightly from behind a pair of gold-rimmed spectacles  after attentively regarding the boy for a time he said in broken english   but m'sieur how can you fly wizout ze ze machine  i have experiment myself wiz some air-ship but you zere is nossing to make go  rob guessed that here was his opportunity to do the demon a favor by explaining his electrical devices to this new acquaintance who was evidently a man of science  here is the secret professor he said and holding out his wrist displayed the traveling machine and explained as well as he could the forces that operated it  the frenchman as you may suppose was greatly astonished and to show how perfectly the machine worked rob turned the indicator and rose a short distance above the tower circling around it before he rejoined the professor on the roof  then he showed his food tablets explaining how each was stored with sufficient nourishment for an entire day  the scientist positively gasped for breath so powerful was the excitement he experienced at witnessing these marvels  eet is wonderful grand magnifique he exclaimed  but here is something of still greater interest continued rob and taking the automatic record of events from his pocket he allowed the professor to view the remarkable scenes that were being enacted throughout the civilized world  the frenchman was now trembling violently and he implored rob to tell him where he might obtain similar electrical machines  i can't do that replied the boy decidedly but having seen these you may be able to discover their construction for yourself  now that you know such things to be possible and practical the hint should be sufficient to enable a shrewd electrician to prepare duplicates of them  the scientist glared at him with evident disappointment and rob continued   these are not all the wonders i can exhibit  here is another electrical device that is perhaps the most remarkable of any i possess  he took the character marking spectacles from his pocket and fitted them to his eyes  then he gave a whistle of surprise and turned his back upon his new friend  he had seen upon the frenchman's forehead the letters e and c  guess i've struck the wrong sort of scientist after all he muttered in a disgusted tone  his companion was quick to prove the accuracy of the character marker seeing the boy's back turned he seized a long iron bar that was used to operate the telescope and struck at rob so fiercely that had he not worn the garment of protection his skull would have been crushed by the blow  at it was the bar rebounded with a force that sent the murderous frenchman sprawling upon the roof and rob turned around and laughed at him  it won't work professor he said  i'm proof against assassins perhaps you had an idea that when you had killed me you could rob me of my valuable possessions but they wouldn't be a particle of use to a scoundrel like you i assure you  good morning  before the surprised and baffled scientist could collect himself sufficiently to reply the boy was soaring far above his head and searching for a convenient place to alight that he might investigate the charms of this famed city of paris  it was indeed a beautiful place with many stately buildings lining the shady boulevards  so thronged were the streets that rob well knew he would soon be the center of a curious crowd should he alight upon them already a few sky-gazers had noted the boy moving high in the air above their heads and one or two groups stood pointing their fingers at him  pausing at length above the imposing structure of the hotel anglais rob noticed at one of the upper floors an open window before which was a small iron balcony  alighting upon this he proceeded to enter without hesitation the open window  he heard a shriek and a cry of au voleur and caught sight of a woman's figure as she dashed into an adjoining room slamming and locking the door behind her  i don't know as i blame her observed rob with a smile at the panic he had created  i s'pose she takes me for a burglar and thinks i've climbed up the lightning rod  he soon found the door leading into the hallway and walked down several flights of stairs until he reached the office of the hotel  how much do you charge a day he inquired addressing a fat and pompous-looking gentlemen behind the desk  the man looked at him in a surprised way for he had not heard the boy enter the room  but he said something in french to a waiter who was passing and the latter came to rob and made a low bow  i speak ze eengliss ver' fine he said  what desire have you  what are your rates by the day asked the boy  ten francs m'sieur  how many dollars is that  dollar americaine  yes united states money  ah oui eet is ze two dollar m'sieur  all right i can stay about a day before i go bankrupt  give me a room  certainement m'sieur  have you ze luggage  no but i'll pay in advance said rob and began counting out his dimes and nickles and pennies to the unbounded amazement of the waiter who looked as if he had never seen such coins before  he carried the money to the fat gentleman who examined the pieces curiously and there was a long conference between them before it was decided to accept them in payment for a room for a day  but at this season the hotel was almost empty and when rob protested that he had no other money the fat gentleman put the coins into his cash box with a resigned sigh and the waiter showed the boy to a little room at the very top of the building  rob washed and brushed the dust from his clothes after which he sat down and amused himself by viewing the pictures that constantly formed upon the polished plate of the record of events     12  how rob saved a republic   while following the shifting scenes of the fascinating record rob noted an occurrence that caused him to give a low whistle of astonishment and devote several moments to serious thought  i believe it's about time i interfered with the politics of this republic he said at last as he closed the lid of the metal box and restored it to his pocket  if i don't take a hand there probably won't be a republic of france very long and as a good american i prefer a republic to a monarchy  then he walked down-stairs and found his english-speaking waiter  where's president loubet he asked  ze president  ah he is wiz his mansion  to be at his residence m'sieur  where is his residence  the waiter began a series of voluble and explicit directions which so confused the boy that he exclaimed   oh much obliged and walked away in disgust  gaining the street he approached a gendarme and repeated his question with no better result than before for the fellow waved his arms wildly in all directions and roared a volley of incomprehensible french phrases that conveyed no meaning whatever  if ever i travel in foreign countries again said rob i'll learn their lingo in advance  why doesn't the demon get up a conversation machine that will speak all languages  by dint of much inquiry however and after walking several miles following ambiguous directions he managed to reach the residence of president loubet  but there he was politely informed that the president was busily engaged in his garden and would see no one  that's all right said the boy calmly  if he's in the garden i'll have no trouble finding him  then to the amazement of the frenchmen rob shot into the air fifty feet or so from which elevation he overlooked a pretty garden in the rear of the president's mansion  the place was protected from ordinary intrusion by high walls but rob descended within the enclosure and walked up to a man who was writing at a small table placed under the spreading branches of a large tree  is this president loubet he inquired with a bow  the gentleman looked up  my servants were instructed to allow no one to disturb me he said speaking in excellent english  it isn't their fault i flew over the wall returned rob  the fact is he added hastily as he noted the president's frown i have come to save the republic and i haven't much time to waste over a bundle of frenchmen either  the president seemed surprised  your name he demanded sharply  robert billings joslyn united states of america  your business monsieur joslyn  rob drew the record from his pocket and placed it upon the table  this sir said he is an electrical device that records all important events  i wish to call your attention to a scene enacted in paris last evening which may have an effect upon the future history of your country  he opened the lid placed the record so that the president could see clearly and then watched the changing expressions upon the great man's face first indifference then interest the next moment eagerness and amazement  mon dieu he gasped the orleanists  rob nodded  yes they've worked up a rather pretty plot haven't they  the president did not reply  he was anxiously watching the record and scribbling notes on a paper beside him  his face was pale and his lips tightly compressed  finally he leaned back in his chair and asked   can you reproduce this scene again  certainly sir answered the boy as often as you like  will you remain here while i send for my minister of police  it will require but a short time  call him up then  i'm in something of a hurry myself but now i've mixed up with this thing i'll see it through  the president touched a bell and gave an order to his servant  then he turned to rob and said wonderingly   you are a boy  that's true mr president was the answer but an american boy you must remember  that makes a big difference i assure you  the president bowed gravely  this is your invention he asked  no i'm hardly equal to that  but the inventor has made me a present of the record and it's the only one in the world  it is a marvel remarked the president thoughtfully  more  it is a real miracle  we are living in an age of wonders my young friend  no one knows that better than myself sir replied rob  but tell me can you trust your chief of police  i think so said the president slowly yet since your invention has shown me that many men i have considered honest are criminally implicated in this royalist plot i hardly know whom to depend upon  then please wear these spectacles during your interview with the minister of police said the boy  you must say nothing while he is with us about certain marks that will appear upon his forehead but when he has gone i will explain those marks so you will understand them  the president covered his eyes with the spectacles  why he exclaimed i see upon your own brow the letters   stop sir interrupted rob with a blush i don't care to know what the letters are if it's just the same to you  the president seemed puzzled by this speech but fortunately the minister of police arrived just then and under rob's guidance the pictured record of the orleanist plot was reproduced before the startled eyes of the official  and now said the boy let us see if any of this foolishness is going on just at present  he turned to the opposite side of the record and allowed the president and his minister of police to witness the quick succession of events even as they occurred  suddenly the minister cried ha and pointing to the figure of a man disembarking from an english boat at calais he said excitedly   that your excellency is the duke of orleans in disguise  i must leave you for a time that i may issue some necessary orders to my men but this evening i shall call to confer with you regarding the best mode of suppressing this terrible plot  when the official had departed the president removed the spectacles from his eyes and handed them to rob  what did you see asked the boy  the letters 'g' and 'w'  then you may trust him fully declared rob and explained the construction of the character marker to the interested and amazed statesman  and now i must go he continued for my stay in your city will be a short one and i want to see all i can  the president scrawled something on a sheet of paper and signed his name to it afterward presenting it with a courteous bow to his visitor  this will enable you to go wherever you please while in paris he said  i regret my inability to reward you properly for the great service you have rendered my country but you have my sincerest gratitude and may command me in any way  oh that's all right answered rob  i thought it was my duty to warn you and if you look sharp you'll be able to break up this conspiracy  but i don't want any reward  good day sir  he turned the indicator of his traveling machine and immediately rose into the air followed by a startled exclamation from the president of france  moving leisurely over the city he selected a deserted thoroughfare to alight in from whence he wandered unobserved into the beautiful boulevards  these were now brilliantly lighted and crowds of pleasure seekers thronged them everywhere  rob experienced a decided sense of relief as he mixed with the gay populace and enjoyed the sights of the splendid city for it enabled him to forget for a time the responsibilities thrust upon him by the possession of the demon's marvelous electrical devices     13  rob loses his treasures   our young adventurer had intended to pass the night in the little bed at his hotel but the atmosphere of paris proved so hot and disagreeable that he decided it would be more enjoyable to sleep while journeying through the cooler air that lay far above the earth's surface  so just as the clocks were striking the midnight hour rob mounted skyward and turned the indicator of the traveling machine to the east intending to make the city of vienna his next stop  he had risen to a considerable distance where the air was remarkably fresh and exhilarating and the relief he experienced from the close and muggy streets of paris was of such a soothing nature that he presently fell fast asleep  his day in the metropolis had been a busy one for like all boys he had forgotten himself in the delight of sight-seeing and had tired his muscles and exhausted his strength to an unusual degree  it was about three o'clock in the morning when rob moving restlessly in his sleep accidently touched with his right hand the indicator of the machine which was fastened to his left wrist setting it a couple of points to the south of east  he was of course unaware of the slight alteration in his course which was destined to prove of serious importance in the near future  for the boy's fatigue induced him to sleep far beyond daybreak and during this period of unconsciousness he was passing over the face of european countries and approaching the lawless and dangerous dominions of the orient  when at last he opened his eyes he was puzzled to determine where he was  beneath him stretched a vast sandy plain and speeding across this he came to a land abounding in luxuriant vegetation  the centrifugal force which propelled him was evidently for some reason greatly accelerated for the scenery of the country he was crossing glided by him at so rapid a rate of speed that it nearly took his breath away  i wonder if i've passed vienna in the night he thought  it ought not to have taken me more than a few hours to reach there from paris  vienna was at that moment fifteen hundred miles behind him but rob's geography had always been his stumbling block at school and he had not learned to gage the speed of the traveling machine so he was completely mystified as to his whereabouts  presently a village having many queer spires and minarets whisked by him like a flash  rob became worried and resolved to slow up at the next sign of habitation  this was a good resolution but turkestan is so thinly settled that before the boy could plan out a course of action he had passed the barren mountain range of thian-shan as nimbly as an acrobat leaps a jumping-bar  this won't do at all he exclaimed earnestly  the traveling machine seems to be running away with me and i'm missing no end of sights by scooting along up here in the clouds  he turned the indicator to zero and was relieved to find it obey with customary quickness  in a few moments he had slowed up and stopped when he found himself suspended above another stretch of sandy plain being too high to see the surface of the plain distinctly he dropped down a few hundred feet to a lower level where he discovered he was surrounded by billows of sand as far as his eye could reach  it's a desert all right was his comment perhaps old sahara herself  he started the machine again towards the east and at a more moderate rate of speed skimmed over the surface of the desert  before long he noticed a dark spot ahead of him which proved to be a large body of fierce looking men riding upon dromedaries and slender spirited horses and armed with long rifles and crookedly shaped simitars  those fellows seem to be looking for trouble remarked the boy as he glided over them and it wouldn't be exactly healthy for an enemy to get in their way  but i haven't time to stop so i'm not likely to get mixed up in any rumpus with them  however the armed caravan was scarcely out of sight before rob discovered he was approaching a rich wooded oasis of the desert in the midst of which was built the walled city of yarkand  not that he had ever heard of the place or knew its name for few europeans and only one american traveler had ever visited it  but he guessed it was a city of some importance from its size and beauty and resolved to make a stop there  above the high walls projected many slender white minarets indicating that the inhabitants were either turks or some race of mohammedans so rob decided to make investigations before trusting himself to their company  a cluster of tall trees with leafy tops stood a short distance outside the walls and here the boy landed and sat down to rest in the refreshing shade  the city seemed as hushed and still as if it were deserted and before him stretched the vast plain of white heated sands  he strained his eyes to catch a glimpse of the band of warriors he had passed but they were moving slowly and had not yet appeared  the trees that sheltered rob were the only ones without the city although many low bushes or shrubs grew scattering over the space between him and the walls  an arched gateway broke the enclosure at his left but the gates were tightly shut  something in the stillness and the intense heat of the mid-day sun made the boy drowsy  he stretched himself upon the ground beneath the dense foliage of the biggest tree and abandoned himself to the languor that was creeping over him  i'll wait until that army of the desert arrives he thought sleepily  they either belong in this city or have come to capture it so i can tell better what to dance when i find out what the band plays  the next moment he was sound asleep sprawling upon his back in the shade and slumbering as peacefully as an infant  and while he lay motionless three men dropped in quick succession from the top of the city wall and hid among the low bushes crawling noiselessly from one to another and so approaching by degrees the little group of trees  they were turks and had been sent by those in authority within the city to climb the tallest tree of the group and discover if the enemy was near  for rob's conjecture had been correct and the city of yarkand awaited with more or less anxiety a threatened assault from its hereditary enemies the tatars  the three spies were not less forbidding in appearance than the horde of warriors rob had passed upon the desert  their features were coarse and swarthy and their eyes had a most villainous glare  old fashioned pistols and double-edged daggers were stuck in their belts and their clothing though of gorgeous colors was soiled and neglected  with all the caution of the american savage these turks approached the tree where to their unbounded amazement they saw the boy lying asleep  his dress and fairness of skin at once proclaimed him in their shrewd eyes a european and their first thought was to glance around in search of his horse or dromedary  seeing nothing of the kind near they were much puzzled to account for his presence and stood looking down at him with evident curiosity  the sun struck the polished surface of the traveling machine which was attached to rob's wrist and made the metal glitter like silver  this attracted the eyes of the tallest turk who stooped down and stealthily unclasped the band of the machine from the boy's outstretched arm then after a hurried but puzzled examination of the little instrument he slipped it into the pocket of his jacket  rob stirred uneasily in his sleep and one of the turks drew a slight but stout rope from his breast and with gentle but deft movement passed it around the boy's wrists and drew them together behind him  the action was not swift enough to arouse the power of repulsion in the garment of protection but it awakened rob effectually so that he sat up and stared hard at his captors  what are you trying to do anyhow he demanded  the turks laughed and said something in their own language  they had no knowledge of english  you're only making fools of yourselves continued the boy wrathfully  it's impossible for you to injure me  the three paid no attention to his words  one of them thrust his hand into rob's pocket and drew out the electric tube  his ignorance of modern appliances was so great that he did not know enough to push the button  rob saw him looking down the hollow end of the tube and murmured   i wish it would blow your ugly head off  but the fellow thinking the shining metal might be of some value to him put the tube in his own pocket and then took from the prisoner the silver box of tablets  rob writhed and groaned at losing his possessions in this way and while his hands were fastened behind him tried to feel for and touch the indicator of the traveling machine  when he found that the machine also had been taken his anger gave way to fear for he realized he was in a dangerously helpless condition  the third turk now drew the record of events from the boy's inner pocket  he knew nothing of the springs that opened the lids so after a curious glance at it he secreted the box in the folds of his sash and continued the search of the captive  the character marking spectacles were next abstracted but the turk seeing in them nothing but spectacles scornfully thrust them back into rob's pocket while his comrades laughed at him  the boy was now rifled of seventeen cents in pennies a broken pocket knife and a lead-pencil the last article seeming to be highly prized  after they had secured all the booty they could find the tall turk who seemed the leader of the three violently kicked at the prisoner with his heavy boot  his surprise was great when the garment of repulsion arrested the blow and nearly overthrew the aggressor in turn snatching a dagger from his sash he bounded upon the boy so fiercely that the next instant the enraged turk found himself lying upon his back three yards away while his dagger flew through the air and landed deep in the desert sands  keep it up cried rob bitterly  i hope you'll enjoy yourself  the other turks raised their comrade to his feet and the three stared at one another in surprise being unable to understand how a bound prisoner could so effectually defend himself  but at a whispered word from the leader they drew their long pistols and fired point blank into rob's face  the volley echoed sharply from the city walls but as the smoke drifted slowly away the turks were horrified to see their intended victim laughing at them  uttering cries of terror and dismay the three took to their heels and bounded towards the wall where a gate quickly opened to receive them the populace feeling sure the tatar horde was upon them  nor was this guess so very far wrong for as rob sitting disconsolate upon the sand raised his eyes he saw across the desert a dark line that marked the approach of the invaders  nearer and nearer they came while rob watched them and bemoaned the foolish impulse that had led him to fall asleep in an unknown land where he could so easily be overpowered and robbed of his treasures  i always suspected these electrical inventions would be my ruin some day he reflected sadly and now i'm side-tracked and left helpless in this outlandish country without a single hope of ever getting home again  they probably won't be able to kill me unless they find my garment of repulsion and strip that off but i never could cross this terrible desert on foot and having lost my food tablets i'd soon starve if i attempted it  fortunately he had eaten one of the tablets just before going to sleep so there was no danger of immediate starvation  but he was miserable and unhappy and remained brooding over his cruel fate until a sudden shout caused him to look up     14  turk and tatar   the tatars had arrived swiftly and noiselessly and a dozen of the warriors still mounted were surrounding him  his helpless condition aroused their curiosity and while some of them hastily cut away his bonds and raised him to his feet other plied him with questions in their own language  rob shook his head to indicate that he could not understand so they led him to the chief an immense bearded representative of the tribe of kara-khitai the terrible and relentless black tatars of thibet  the huge frame of this fellow was clothed in flowing robes of cloth-of-gold braided with jewels and he sat majestically upon the back of a jet-black camel  under ordinary circumstances the stern features and flashing black eyes of this redoubtable warrior would have struck a chill of fear to the boy's heart but now under the influence of the crushing misfortunes he had experienced he was able to gaze with indifference upon the terrible visage of the desert chief  the tatar seemed not to consider rob an enemy  instead he looked upon him as an ally since the turks had bound and robbed him  finding it impossible to converse with the chief rob took refuge in the sign language  he turned his pockets wrong side out showed the red welts left upon his wrists by the tight cord and then shook his fists angrily in the direction of the town  in return the tatar nodded gravely and issued an order to his men  by this time the warriors were busily pitching tents before the walls of yarkand and making preparations for a formal siege  in obedience to the chieftain's orders rob was given a place within one of the tents nearest the wall and supplied with a brace of brass-mounted pistols and a dagger with a sharp zigzag edge  these were evidently to assist the boy in fighting the turks and he was well pleased to have them  his spirits rose considerably when he found he had fallen among friends although most of his new comrades had such evil faces that it was unnecessary to put on the character markers to judge their natures with a fair degree of accuracy  i can't be very particular about the company i keep he thought and this gang hasn't tried to murder me as the rascally turks did  so for the present i'll stand in with the scowling chief and try to get a shot at the thieves who robbed me  if our side wins i may get a chance to recover some of my property  it's a slim chance of course but it's the only hope i have left  that very evening an opportunity occurred for rob to win glory in the eyes of his new friends  just before sundown the gates of the city flew open and a swarm of turks mounted upon fleet horses and camels issued forth and fell upon their enemies  the tatars who did not expect the sally were scarcely able to form an opposing rank when they found themselves engaged in a hand-to-hand conflict fighting desperately for their lives  in such a battle however the turks were at a disadvantage for the active tatars slipped beneath their horses and disabled them bringing both the animals and their riders to the earth  at the first onslaught rob shot his pistol at a turk and wounded him so severely that he fell from his horse  instantly the boy seized the bridle and sprang upon the steed's back and the next moment he had dashed into the thickest part of the fray  bullets and blows rained upon him from all sides but the garment of repulsion saved him from a single scratch  when his pistols had been discharged he caught up the broken handle of a spear and used it as a club galloping into the ranks of the turks and belaboring them as hard as he could  the tatars cheered and followed him and the turks were so amazed at his miraculous escape from their bullets that they became terrified thinking he bore a charmed life and was protected by unseen powers  this terror helped turn the tide of battle and before long the enemy was pressed back to the walls and retreated through the gates which were hastily fastened behind them  in order to prevent a repetition of this sally the tatars at once invested the gates so that if the turks should open them they were as likely to let their foes in as to oppose them  while the tents were being moved up rob had an opportunity to search the battlefield for the bodies of the three turks who had robbed him but they were not among the fallen  those fellows were too cowardly to take part in a fair fight declared the boy but he was much disappointed nevertheless as he felt very helpless without the electric tube or the traveling machine  the tatar chief now called rob to his tent and presented him with a beautiful ring set with a glowing pigeon's-blood ruby in acknowledgment of his services  this gift made the boy feel very proud and he said to the chief   you're all right old man even if you do look like a pirate  if you can manage to capture that city so i can get my electrical devices back i'll consider you a trump as long as i live  the chief thought this speech was intended to express rob's gratitude so he bowed solemnly in return  during the night that followed upon the first engagement of the turks and tatars the boy lay awake trying to devise some plan to capture the city  the walls seemed too high and thick to be either scaled or broken by the tatars who had no artillery whatever and within the walls lay all the fertile part of the oasis giving the besieged a good supply of water and provisions while the besiegers were obliged to subsist on what water and food they had brought with them  just before dawn rob left his tent and went out to look at the great wall  the stars gave plenty of light but the boy was worried to find that according to eastern custom no sentries or guards whatever had been posted and all the tatars were slumbering soundly  the city was likewise wrapped in profound silence but just as rob was turning away he saw a head project stealthily over the edge of the wall before him and recognized in the features one of the turks who had robbed him  finding no one awake except the boy the fellow sat upon the edge of the wall with his feet dangling downward and grinned wickedly at his former victim  rob watched him with almost breathless eagerness  after making many motions that conveyed no meaning whatever the turk drew the electric tube from his pocket and pointed his finger first at the boy and then at the instrument as if inquiring what it was used for  rob shook his head  the turk turned the tube over several times and examined it carefully after which he also shook his head seeming greatly puzzled  by this time the boy was fairly trembling with excitement  he longed to recover this valuable weapon and feared that at any moment the curious turk would discover its use  he held out his hand toward the tube and tried to say by motions that he would show the fellow how to use it  the man seemed to understand by he would not let the glittering instrument out of his possession  rob was almost in despair when he happened to notice upon his hand the ruby ring given him by the chief  drawing the jewel from his finger he made offer by signs that he would exchange it for the tube  the turk was much pleased with the idea and nodded his head repeatedly holding out his hand for the ring  rob had little confidence in the man's honor but he was so eager to regain the tube that he decided to trust him  so he threw the ring to the top of the wall where the turk caught it skilfully but when rob held out his hand for the tube the scoundrel only laughed at him and began to scramble to his feet in order to beat a retreat  chance however foiled this disgraceful treachery for in his hurry the turk allowed the tube to slip from his grasp and it rolled off the wall and fell upon the sand at rob's very feet  the robber turned to watch its fall and filled with sudden anger the boy grabbed the weapon pointed it at his enemy and pressed the button  down tumbled the turk without a cry and lay motionless at the foot of the wall  rob's first thought was to search the pockets of his captive and to his delight he found and recovered his box of food tablets  the record of events and the traveling machine were doubtless in the possession of the other robbers but rob did not despair of recovering them now that he had the tube to aid him  day was now breaking and several of the tatars appeared and examined the body of the turk with grunts of surprise for there was no mark upon him to show how he had been slain  supposing him to be dead they tossed him aside and forgot all about him  rob had secured his ruby ring again and going to the chief's tent he showed the jewel to the guard and was at once admitted  the black-bearded chieftain was still reclining upon his pillows but rob bowed before him and by means of signs managed to ask for a band of warriors to assist him in assaulting the town  the chieftain appeared to doubt the wisdom of the enterprise not being able to understand how the boy could expect to succeed but he graciously issued the required order and by the time rob reached the city gate he found a large group of tatars gathered to support him while the entire camp roused to interest in the proceedings stood looking on  rob cared little for the quarrel between the turks and tatars and under ordinary circumstances would have refused to side with one or the other but he knew he could not hope to recover his electrical machines unless the city was taken by the band of warriors who had befriended him so he determined to force an entrance for them  without hesitation he walked close to the great gate and shattered its fastenings with the force of the electric current directed upon them from the tube  then shouting to his friends the tatars for assistance they rushed in a body upon the gate and dashed it open  the turks had expected trouble when they heard the fastenings of the huge gate splinter and fall apart so they had assembled in force before the opening  as the tatars poured through the gateway in a compact mass they were met by a hail of bullets spears and arrows which did fearful execution among them  many were killed outright while others fell wounded to be trampled upon by those who pressed on from the rear  rob maintained his position in the front rank but escaped all injury through the possession of the garment of repulsion  but he took an active part in the fight and pressed the button of the electric tube again and again tumbling the enemy into heaps on every side even the horses and camels falling helplessly before the resistless current of electricity  the tatars shouted joyfully as they witnessed this marvelous feat and rushed forward to assist in the slaughter but the boy motioned them all back  he did not wish any more bloodshed than was necessary and knew that the heaps of unconscious turks around him would soon recover  so he stood alone and faced the enemy calmly knocking them over as fast as they came near  two of the turks managed to creep up behind the boy and one of them who wielded an immense simitar with a two-edged blade as sharp as a razor swung the weapon fiercely to cut off rob's head  but the repulsive force aroused in the garment was so terrific that it sent the weapon flying backwards with redoubled swiftness so that it caught the second turk at the waist and cut him fairly in two  thereafter they all avoided coming near the boy and in a surprisingly short time the turkish forces were entirely conquered all having been reduced to unconsciousness except a few cowards who had run away and hidden in the cellars or garrets of the houses  the tatars entered the city with shouts of triumph and the chief was so delighted that he threw his arms around rob's neck and embraced him warmly  then began the sack of yarkand the fierce tatars plundering the bazaars and houses stripping them of everything of value they could find  rob searched anxiously among the bodies of the unconscious turks for the two men who had robbed him but neither could be found  he was more successful later for in running through the streets he came upon a band of tatars leading a man with a rope around his neck whom rob quickly recognized as one of the thieves he was hunting for  the tatars willingly allowed him to search the fellow and in one of his pockets rob found the record of events  he had now recovered all his property except the traveling machine the one thing that was absolutely necessary to enable him to escape from this barbarous country  he continued his search persistently and an hour later found the dead body of the third robber lying in the square in the center of the city but the traveling machine was not on his person and for the first time the boy began to give way to despair  in the distance he heard loud shouts and sound of renewed strife warning him that the turks were recovering consciousness and engaging the tatars with great fierceness  the latter had scattered throughout the town thinking themselves perfectly secure so that not only were they unprepared to fight but they became panic-stricken at seeing their foes return as it seemed from death to life  their usual courage forsook them and they ran terrified in every direction only to be cut down by the revengeful turkish simitars  rob was sitting upon the edge of a marble fountain in the center of the square when a crowd of victorious turks appeared and quickly surrounded him  the boy paid no attention to their gestures and the turks feared to approach him nearly so they stood a short distance away and fired volleys at him from their rifles and pistols  rob glared at them scornfully and seeing they could not injure him the turks desisted but they still surrounded him and the crowd grew thicker every moment  women now came creeping from their hiding places and mingled with the ranks of the men and rob guessed from their joyous chattering that the turks had regained the city and driven out or killed the tatar warriors  he reflected gloomily that this did not affect his own position in any way since he could not escape from the oasis  suddenly on glancing at the crowd rob saw something that arrested his attention  a young girl was fastening some article to the wrist of a burly villainous-looking turk  the boy saw a glitter that reminded him of the traveling machine but immediately afterward the man and the girl bent their heads over the fellow's wrist in such a way that rob could see nothing more  while the couple were apparently examining the strange device rob started to his feet and walked toward them  the crowd fell back at his approach but the man and the girl were so interested that they did not notice him  he was still several paces away when the girl put out her finger and touched the indicator on the dial  to rob's horror and consternation the big turk began to rise slowly into the air while a howl of fear burst from the crowd  but the boy made a mighty spring and caught the turk by his foot clinging to it with desperate tenacity while they both mounted steadily upward until they were far above the city of the desert  the big turk screamed pitifully at first and then actually fainted away from fright  rob was much frightened on his part for he knew if his hands slipped from their hold he would fall to his death  indeed one hand was slipping already so he made a frantic clutch and caught firmly hold of the turk's baggy trousers  then slowly and carefully he drew himself up and seized the leather belt that encircled the man's waist  this firm grip gave him new confidence and he began to breathe more freely  he now clung to the body of the turk with both legs entwined in the way he was accustomed to cling to a tree-trunk when he climbed after cherries at home  he had conquered his fear of falling and took time to recover his wits and his strength  they had now reached such a tremendous height that the city looked like a speck on the desert beneath them  knowing he must act quickly rob seized the dangling left arm of the unconscious turk and raised it until he could reach the dial of the traveling machine  he feared to unclasp the machine just then for two reasons  if it slipped from his grasp they would both plunge downward to their death and he was not sure the machine would work at all if in any other position than fastened to the left wrist  rob determined to take no chances so he left the machine attached to the turk and turned the indicator to zero and then to east for he did not wish to rejoin either his enemies the turks or his equally undesirable friends the tatars  after traveling eastward a few minutes he lost sight of the city altogether so still clinging to the body of the turk he again turned the indicator and began to descend  when at last they landed gently upon a rocky eminence of the kuen-lun mountains the boy's strength was almost exhausted and his limbs ached with the strain of clinging to the turk's body  his first act was to transfer the traveling machine to his own wrist and to see that his other electrical devices were safely bestowed in his pockets  then he sat upon the rock to rest until the turk recovered consciousness  presently the fellow moved uneasily rolled over and then sat up and stared at his surroundings  perhaps he thought he had been dreaming for he rubbed his eyes and looked again with mingled surprise and alarm  then seeing rob he uttered a savage shout and drew his dagger  rob smiled and pointed the electric tube at the man who doubtless recognized its power for he fell back scowling and trembling  this place seems like a good jog from civilization remarked the boy as coolly as if his companion could understand what he said but as your legs are long and strong you may be able to find your way  it's true you're liable to starve to death but if you do it will be your own misfortune and not my fault  the turk glared at him sullenly but did not attempt to reply  rob took out his box of tablets ate one of them and offered another to his enemy  the fellow accepted it ungraciously enough but seeing rob eat one he decided to follow his example and consumed the tablet with a queer expression of distrust upon his face  brave man cried rob laughingly you've avoided the pangs of starvation for a time anyhow so i can leave you with a clear conscience  without more ado he turned the indicator of the traveling machine and mounted into the air leaving the turk sitting upon the rocks and staring after him in comical bewilderment     15  a battle with monsters   our young adventurer never experienced a more grateful feeling of relief and security than when he found himself once more high in the air alone and in undisputed possession of the electrical devices bestowed upon him by the demon  the dangers he had passed through since landing at the city of the desert and the desperate chance that alone had permitted him to regain the traveling machine made him shudder at the bare recollection and rendered him more sober and thoughtful than usual  we who stick closely to the earth's surface can scarcely realize how rob could travel through the air at such dizzy heights without any fear or concern whatsoever  but he had come to consider the air a veritable refuge  experience had given him implicit confidence in the powers of the electrical instrument whose unseen forces carried him so swiftly and surely and while the tiny watch-like machine was clasped to his wrist he felt himself to be absolutely safe  having slipped away from the turk and attained a fair altitude he set the indicator at zero and paused long enough to consult his map and decide what direction it was best for him to take  the mischance that had swept him unwittingly over the countries of europe had also carried him more than half way around the world from his home  therefore the nearest way to reach america would be to continue traveling to the eastward  so much time had been consumed at the desert oasis that he felt he must now hasten if he wished to reach home by saturday afternoon so having quickly come to a decision he turned the indicator and began a swift flight into the east  for several hours he traveled above the great desert of gobi but by noon signs of a more fertile country began to appear and dropping to a point nearer the earth he was able to observe closely the country of the chinese with its crowded population and ancient but crude civilization  then he came to the great wall of china and to mighty peking above which he hovered some time examining it curiously  he really longed to make a stop there but with his late experiences fresh in his mind he thought it much safer to view the wonderful city from a distance  resuming his flight he presently came to the gulf of laou tong whose fair face was freckled with many ships of many nations and so on to korea which seemed to him a land fully a century behind the times  night overtook him while speeding across the sea of japan and having a great desire to view the mikado's famous islands he put the indicator at zero and coming to a full stop composed himself to sleep until morning that he might run no chances of being carried beyond his knowledge during the night  you might suppose it no easy task to sleep suspended in mid-air yet the magnetic currents controlled by the traveling machine were so evenly balanced that rob was fully as comfortable as if reposing upon a bed of down  he had become somewhat accustomed to passing the night in the air and now slept remarkably well having no fear of burglars or fire or other interruptions that dwellers in cities are subject to  one thing however he should have remembered  that he was in an ancient and little known part of the world and reposing above a sea famous in fable as the home of many fierce and terrible creatures while not far away lay the land of the dragon the simurg and other ferocious monsters  rob may have read of these things in fairy tales and books of travel but if so they had entirely slipped his mind so he slumbered peacefully and actually snored a little i believe towards morning  but even as the red sun peeped curiously over the horizon he was awakened by a most unusual disturbance a succession of hoarse screams and a pounding of the air as from the quickly revolving blades of some huge windmill  he rubbed his eyes and looked around  coming towards him at his right hand was an immense bird whose body seemed almost as big as that of a horse  its wide-open curving beak was set with rows of pointed teeth and the talons held against its breast and turned threateningly outward were more powerful and dreadful than a tiger's claws  while fascinated and horrified he watched the approach of this feathered monster a scream sounded just behind him and the next instant the stroke of a mighty wing sent him whirling over and over through the air  he soon came to a stop however and saw that another of the monsters had come upon him from the rear and was now with its mate circling closely around him while both uttered continuously their hoarse savage cries  rob wondered why the garment of repulsion had not protected him from the blow of the bird's wing but as a matter of fact it had protected him  for it was not the wing itself but the force of the eddying currents of air that had sent him whirling away from the monster  with the indicator at zero the magnetic currents and the opposing powers of attraction and repulsion were so evenly balanced that any violent atmospheric disturbance affected him in the same way that thistledown is affected by a summer breeze  he had noticed something of this before but whenever a strong wind was blowing he was accustomed to rise to a position above the air currents  this was the first time he had slept with the indicator at zero  the huge birds at once renewed their attack but rob had now recovered his wits sufficiently to draw the electric tube from his pocket  the first one to dart towards him received the powerful electric current direct from the tube and fell stunned and fluttering to the surface of the sea where it floated motionless  its mate perhaps warned by this sudden disaster renewed its circling flight moving so swiftly that rob could scarcely follow it and drawing nearer and nearer every moment to its intended victim  the boy could not turn in the air very quickly and he feared an attack in the back mistrusting the saving power of the garment of repulsion under such circumstances so in desperation he pressed his finger upon the button of the tube and whirled the instrument around his head in the opposite direction to that in which the monster was circling  presently the current and the bird met and with one last scream the creature tumbled downwards to join its fellow upon the waves where they lay like two floating islands  their presence had left a rank sickening stench in the surrounding atmosphere so rob made haste to resume his journey and was soon moving rapidly eastward  he could not control a shudder at the recollection of his recent combat and realized the horror of a meeting with such creatures by one who had no protection from their sharp beaks and talons  it's no wonder the japs draw ugly pictures of those monsters he thought  people who live in these parts must pass most of their lives in a tremble  the sun was now shining brilliantly and when the beautiful islands of japan came in sight rob found that he had recovered his wonted cheerfulness  he moved along slowly hovering with curious interest over the quaint and picturesque villages and watching the industrious japanese patiently toiling at their tasks  just before he reached tokio he came to a military fort and for nearly an hour watched the skilful maneuvers of a regiment of soldiers at their morning drill they were not very big people compared with other nations but they seemed alert and well trained and the boy decided it would require a brave enemy to face them on a field of battle  having at length satisfied his curiosity as to japanese life and customs rob prepared for his long flight across the pacific ocean  by consulting his map he discovered that should he maintain his course due east as before he would arrive at a point in america very near to san francisco which suited his plans excellently  having found that he moved more swiftly when farthest from the earth's surface because the air was more rarefied and offered less resistance rob mounted upwards until the islands of japan were mere specks visible through the clear sunny atmosphere  then he began his eastward flight the broad surface of the pacific seeming like a blue cloud far beneath him     16  shipwrecked mariners   ample proof of rob's careless and restless nature having been frankly placed before the reader in these pages you will doubtless be surprised when i relate that during the next few hours our young gentleman suffered from a severe attack of homesickness becoming as gloomy and unhappy in its duration as ever a homesick boy could be  it may have been because he was just then cut off from all his fellow-creatures and even from the world itself it may have been because he was satiated with marvels and with the almost absolute control over the powers which the demon had conferred upon him or it may have been because he was born and reared a hearty healthy american boy with a disposition to battle openly with the world and take his chances equally with his fellows rather than be placed in such an exclusive position that no one could hope successfully to oppose him  perhaps he himself did not know what gave him this horrible attack of the blues but the truth is he took out his handkerchief and cried like a baby from very loneliness and misery  there was no one to see him thank goodness and the tears gave him considerable relief  he dried his eyes made an honest struggle to regain his cheerfulness and then muttered to himself   if i stay up here like an air-bubble in the sky i shall certainly go crazy  i suppose there's nothing but water to look at down below but if i could only sight a ship or even see a fish jump it would do me no end of good  thereupon he descended until as the ocean's surface same nearer and nearer he discovered a tiny island lying almost directly underneath him  it was hardly big enough to make a dot on the biggest map but a clump of trees grew in the central portion while around the edges were jagged rocks protecting a sandy beach and a stretch of flower-strewn upland leading to the trees  it looked beautiful from rob's elevated position and his spirits brightened at once  i'll drop down and pick a bouquet he exclaimed and a few moments later his feet touched the firm earth of the island  but before he could gather a dozen of the brilliant flowers a glad shout reached his ears and looking up he saw two men running towards him from the trees  they were dressed in sailor fashion but their clothing was reduced to rags and scarcely clung to their brown skinny bodies  as they advanced they waved their arms wildly in the air and cried in joyful tones   a boat a boat  rob stared at them wonderingly and had much ado to prevent the poor fellows from hugging him outright so great was their joy at his appearance  one of them rolled upon the ground laughing and crying by turns while the other danced and cut capers until he became so exhausted that he sank down breathless beside his comrade  how came you here then inquired the boy in pitying tones  we're shipwrecked american sailors from the bark 'cynthia jane' which went down near here over a month ago answered the smallest and thinnest of the two  we escaped by clinging to a bit of wreckage and floated to this island where we have nearly starved to death  indeed we now have eaten everything on the island that was eatable and had your boat arrived a few days later you'd have found us lying dead upon the beach  rob listened to this sad tale with real sympathy  but i didn't come here in a boat said he  the men sprang to their feet with white scared faces  no boat they cried are you too shipwrecked  no he answered  i flew here through the air  and then he explained to them the wonderful electric traveling machine  but the sailors had no interest whatever in the relation  their disappointment was something awful to witness and one of them laid his head upon his comrade's shoulder and wept with unrestrained grief so weak and discouraged had they become through suffering  suddenly rob remembered that he could assist them and took the box of concentrated food tablets from his pocket  eat these he said offering one of each to the sailors  at first they could not understand that these small tablets would be able to allay the pangs of hunger but when rob explained their virtues the men ate them greedily  within a few moments they were so greatly restored to strength and courage that their eyes brightened their sunken cheeks flushed and they were able to converse with their benefactor with calmness and intelligence  then the boy sat beside them upon the grass and told them the story of his acquaintance with the demon and of all his adventures since he had come into possession of the wonderful electric contrivances  in his present mood he felt it would be a relief to confide in some one and so these poor lonely men were the first to hear his story  when he related the manner in which he had clung to the turk while both ascended into the air the elder of the two sailors listened with rapt attention and then after some thought asked   why couldn't you carry one or both of us to america  rob took time seriously to consider this idea while the sailors eyed him with eager interest  finally he said   i'm afraid i couldn't support your weight long enough to reach any other land  it's a long journey and you'd pull my arms out of joint before we'd been up an hour  their faces fell at this but one of them said   why couldn't we swing ourselves over your shoulders with a rope  our two bodies would balance each other and we are so thin and emaciated that we do not weigh very much  while considering this suggestion rob remembered how at one time five pirates had clung to his left leg and been carried some distance through the air  have you a rope he asked  no was the answer but there are plenty of long tough vines growing on the island that are just as strong and pliable as ropes  then if you are willing to run the chances decided the boy i will make the attempt to save you  but i must warn you that in case i find i can not support the weight of your bodies i shall drop one or both of you into the sea  they looked grave at this prospect but the biggest one said   we would soon meet death from starvation if you left us here on the island so as there is at least a chance of our being able to escape in your company i for one am willing to risk being drowned  it is easier and quicker than being starved  and as i'm the heavier i suppose you'll drop me first  certainly declared rob promptly  this announcement seemed to be an encouragement to the little sailor but he said nervously   i hope you'll keep near the water for i haven't a good head for heights they always make me dizzy  oh if you don't want to go began rob i can easily   but i do i do i do cried the little man interrupting him  i shall die if you leave me behind  well then get your ropes and we'll do the best we can said the boy  they ran to the trees around the trunks of which were clinging many tendrils of greenish-brown vine which possessed remarkable strength with their knives they cut a long section of this vine the ends of which were then tied into loops large enough to permit the sailors to sit in them comfortably  the connecting piece rob padded with seaweed gathered from the shore to prevent its cutting into his shoulders  now then he said when all was ready take your places  the sailors squatted in the loops and rob swung the vine over his shoulders and turned the indicator of the traveling machine to up  as they slowly mounted into the sky the little sailor gave a squeal of terror and clung to the boy's arm but the other although seemingly anxious sat quietly in his place and made no trouble  d d don't g g go so high stammered the little one tremblingly suppose we should f f fall  well s'pose we should answered rob gruffly  you couldn't drown until you struck the water so the higher we are the longer you'll live in case of accident  this phase of the question seemed to comfort the frightened fellow somewhat but as he said he had not a good head for heights and so continued to tremble in spite of his resolve to be brave  the weight on rob's shoulders was not so great as he had feared the traveling machine seeming to give a certain lightness and buoyancy to everything that came into contact with its wearer  as soon as he had reached a sufficient elevation to admit of good speed he turned the indicator once more to the east and began moving rapidly through the air the shipwrecked sailors dangling at either side  this is aw aw awful gasped the little one  say you shut up commanded the boy angrily  if your friend was as big a coward as you are i'd drop you both this minute  let go my arm and keep quiet if you want to reach land alive  the fellow whimpered a little but managed to remain silent for several minutes  then he gave a sudden twitch and grabbed rob's arm again  s'pose s'pose the vine should break he moaned a horrified look upon his face  i've had about enough of this said rob savagely  if you haven't any sense you don't deserve to live  he turned the indicator on the dial of the machine and they began to descend rapidly  the little fellow screamed with fear but rob paid no attention to him until the feet of the two suspended sailors were actually dipping into the waves when he brought their progress to an abrupt halt  wh wh what are you g g going to do gurgled the cowardly sailor  i'm going to feed you to the sharks unless you promise to keep your mouth shut retorted the boy  now then decide at once  which will it be sharks or silence  i won't say a word 'pon my honor i won't said the sailor shudderingly  all right remember your promise and we'll have no further trouble remarked rob who had hard work to keep from laughing at the man's abject terror  once more he ascended and continued the journey and for several hours they rode along swiftly and silently  rob's shoulders were beginning to ache with the continued tugging of the vine upon them but the thought that he was saving the lives of two unfortunate fellow-creatures gave him strength and courage to persevere  night was falling when they first sighted land a wild and seemingly uninhabited stretch of the american coast  rob made no effort to select a landing place for he was nearly worn out with a strain and anxiety of the journey  he dropped his burden upon the brow of a high bluff overlooking the sea and casting the vine from his shoulders fell to the earth exhausted and half fainting     17  the coast of oregon   when he had somewhat recovered rob sat up and looked around him  the elder sailor was kneeling in earnest prayer offering grateful thanks for his escape from suffering and death  the younger one lay upon the ground sobbing and still violently agitated by recollections of the frightful experiences he had undergone  although he did not show his feelings as plainly as the men the boy was none the less gratified at having been instrumental in saving the lives of two fellow-beings  the darkness was by this time rapidly enveloping them so rob asked his companions to gather some brushwood and light a fire which they quickly did  the evening was cool for the time of year and the heat from the fire was cheering and grateful so they all lay near the glowing embers and fell fast asleep  the sound of voices aroused rob next morning and on opening his eyes and gazing around he saw several rudely dressed men approaching  the two shipwrecked sailors were still sound asleep  rob stood up and waited for the strangers to draw near  they seemed to be fishermen and were much surprised at finding three people asleep upon the bluff  whar 'n thunder 'd ye come from asked the foremost fisherman in a surprised voice  from the sea replied the boy  my friends here are shipwrecked sailors from the 'cynthia jane'  but how'd ye make out to climb the bluff inquired a second fisherman no one ever did it afore as we knows on  oh that is a long story replied the boy evasively  the two sailors had awakened and now saluted the new-comers  soon they were exchanging a running fire of questions and answers  where are we rob heard the little sailor ask  coast of oregon was the reply  we're about seven miles from port orford by land an' about ten miles by sea  do you live at port orford inquired the sailor  that's what we do friend an' if your party wants to join us we'll do our best to make you comf'table bein' as you're shipwrecked an' need help  just then a loud laugh came from another group where the elder sailor had been trying to explain rob's method of flying through the air  laugh all you want to said the sailor sullenly it's true ev'ry word of it  mebbe you think it friend answered a big good-natured fisherman but it's well known that shipwrecked folks go crazy sometimes an' imagine strange things  your mind seems clear enough in other ways so i advise you to try and forget your dreams about flyin'  rob now stepped forward and shook hands with the sailors  i see you have found friends he said to them so i will leave you and continue my journey as i'm in something of a hurry  both sailors began to thank him profusely for their rescue but he cut them short  that's all right  of course i couldn't leave you on that island to starve to death and i'm glad i was able to bring you away with me  but you threatened to drop me into the sea remarked the little sailor in a grieved voice  so i did said rob laughing but i wouldn't have done it for the world not even to have saved my own life  good-by  he turned the indicator and mounted skyward to the unbounded amazement of the fishermen who stared after him with round eyes and wide open mouths  this sight will prove to them that the sailors are not crazy he thought as he turned to the south and sped away from the bluff  i suppose those simple fishermen will never forget this wonderful occurrence and they'll probably make reg'lar heroes of the two men who have crossed the pacific through the air  he followed the coast line keeping but a short distance above the earth and after an hour's swift flight reached the city of san francisco  his shoulders were sore and stiff from the heavy strain upon them of the previous day and he wished more than once that he had some of his mother's household liniment to rub them with  yet so great was his delight at reaching once more his native land that all discomforts were speedily forgotten  much as he would have enjoyed a day in the great metropolis of the pacific slope rob dared not delay longer than to take a general view of the place to note its handsome edifices and to wonder at the throng of chinese inhabiting one section of the town  these things were much more plainly and quickly viewed by rob from above than by threading a way through the streets on foot for he looked down upon the city as a bird does and covered miles with a single glance  having satisfied his curiosity without attempting to alight he turned to the southeast and followed the peninsula as far as palo alto where he viewed the magnificent buildings of the university  changing his course to the east he soon reached mount hamilton and being attracted by the great tower of the lick observatory he hovered over it until he found he had attracted the excited gaze of the inhabitants who doubtless observed him very plainly through the big telescope  but so unreal and seemingly impossible was the sight witnessed by the learned astronomers that they have never ventured to make the incident public although long after the boy had darted away into the east they argued together concerning the marvelous and incomprehensible vision afterward they secretly engrossed the circumstance upon their records but resolved never to mention it in public lest their wisdom and veracity should be assailed by the skeptical  meantime rob rose to a higher altitude and sped swiftly across the great continent  by noon he sighted chicago and after a brief inspection of the place from the air determined to devote at least an hour to forming the acquaintance of this most wonderful and cosmopolitan city     18  a narrow escape   the auditorium tower where the weather man sits to flash his reports throughout the country offered an inviting place for the boy to alight  he dropped quietly upon the roof of the great building and walked down the staircase until he reached the elevators by means of which he descended to the ground floor without exciting special attention  the eager rush and hurry of the people crowding the sidewalks impressed rob with the idea that they were all behind time and were trying hard to catch up  he found it impossible to walk along comfortably without being elbowed and pushed from side to side so a half hour's sight-seeing under such difficulties tired him greatly  it was a beautiful afternoon and finding himself upon the lake front rob hunted up a vacant bench and sat down to rest  presently an elderly gentleman with a reserved and dignified appearance and dressed in black took a seat next to the boy and drew a magazine from his pocket  rob saw that he opened it to an article on the progress of modern science in which he seemed greatly interested  after a time the boy remembered that he was hungry not having eaten a tablet in more than twenty-four hours  so he took out the silver box and ate one of the small round disks it contained  what are those inquired the old gentleman in a soft voice  you are too young to be taking patent medicines  there are not medicines exactly answered the boy with a smile they are concentrated food tablets sorted with nourishment by means of electricity  one of them furnishes a person with food for an entire day  the old gentleman stared at rob a moment and then laid down his magazine and took the box in his hands examining the tablets curiously  are these patented he asked  no said rob they are unknown to any one but myself  i will give you a half million dollars for the recipe to make them said the gentleman  i fear i must refuse your offer returned rob with a laugh  i'll make it a million said the gentleman coolly  rob shook his head  money can't buy the recipe he said for i don't know it myself  couldn't the tablets be chemically analyzed and the secret discovered inquired the other  i don't know but i'm not going to give any one the chance to try declared the boy firmly  the old gentleman picked up his magazine without another word and resumed his reading  for amusement rob took the record of events from his pocket and began looking at the scenes reflected from its polished plate  presently he became aware that the old gentleman was peering over his shoulder with intense interest  general funston was just then engaged in capturing the rebel chief aguinaldo and for a few moments both man and boy observed the occurrence with rapt attention  as the scene was replaced by one showing a secret tunnel of the russian nihilists with the conspirators carrying dynamite to a recess underneath the palace of the czar the gentleman uttered a long sigh and asked   will you sell that box  no answered rob shortly and put it back into his pocket  i'll give you a million dollars to control the sale in chicago alone continued the gentleman with an eager inflection in his smooth voice  you seem quite anxious to get rid of money remarked rob carelessly how much are you worth  personally  yes  nothing at all young man  i am not offering you my own money  but with such inventions as you have exhibited i could easily secure millions of capital  suppose we form a trust and place them upon the market  we'll capitalize it for a hundred millions and you can have a quarter of the stock twenty-five millions  that would keep you from worrying about grocery bills  but i wouldn't need groceries if i had the tablets said rob laughing  true enough  but you could take life easily and read your newspaper in comfort without being in any hurry to get down town to business twenty-five millions would bring you a cozy little income if properly invested  i don't see why one should read newspapers when the record of events shows all that is going on in the world objected rob  true true  but what do you say to the proposition  i must decline with thanks  these inventions are not for sale  the gentleman sighed and resumed his magazine in which he became much absorbed  rob put on the character marking spectacles and looked at him  the letters e w and c were plainly visible upon the composed respectable looking brow of his companion  evil wise and cruel reflected rob as he restored the spectacles to his pocket  how easily such a man could impose upon people  to look at him one would think that butter wouldn't melt in his mouth  he decided to part company with this chance acquaintance and rising from his seat strolled leisurely up the walk  a moment later on looking back he discovered that the old gentleman had disappeared  he walked down state street to the river and back again amused by the activity displayed in this busy section of the city  but the time he had allowed himself in chicago had now expired so he began looking around for some high building from the roof of which he could depart unnoticed  this was not at all difficult and selecting one of many stores he ascended by an elevator to the top floor and from there mounted an iron stairway leading to the flat roof  as he climbed this stairway he found himself followed by a pleasant looking young man who also seemed desirous of viewing the city from the roof  annoyed at the inopportune intrusion rob's first thought was to go back to the street and try another building but upon reflecting that the young man was not likely to remain long and he would soon be alone he decided to wait  so he walked to the edge of the roof and appeared to be interested in the scenery spread out below him  fine view from here ain't it said the young man coming up to him and placing his hand carelessly upon the boy's shoulder  it is indeed replied rob leaning over the edge to look into the street  as he spoke he felt himself gently but firmly pushed from behind and losing his balance he plunged headforemost from the roof and whirled through the intervening space toward the sidewalk far below  terrified though he was by the sudden disaster the boy had still wit enough remaining to reach out his right hand and move the indicator of the machine upon his left wrist to the zero mark  immediately he paused in his fearful flight and presently came to a stop at a distance of less than fifteen feet from the flagstones which had threatened to crush out his life  as he stared downward trying to recover his self-possession he saw the old gentleman he had met on the lake front standing just below and looking at him with a half frightened half curious expression in his eyes  at once rob saw through the whole plot to kill him and thus secure possession of his electrical devices  the young man upon the roof who had attempted to push him to his death was a confederate of the innocent appearing old gentleman it seemed and the latter had calmly awaited his fall to the pavement to seize the coveted treasures from his dead body  it was an awful idea and rob was more frightened than he had ever been before in his life or ever has been since  but now the shouts of a vast concourse of amazed spectators reached the boy's ears  he remembered that he was suspended in mid-air over the crowded street of a great city while thousands of wondering eyes were fixed upon him  so he quickly set the indicator to the word up and mounted sky-ward until the watchers below could scarcely see him  then he fled away into the east even yet shuddering with the horror of his recent escape from death and filled with disgust at the knowledge that there were people who held human life so lightly that they were willing to destroy it to further their own selfish ends  and the demon wants such people as these to possess his electrical devices which are as powerful to accomplish evil when in wrong hands as they are good thought the boy resentfully  this would be a fine world if electric tubes and records of events and traveling machines could be acquired by selfish and unprincipled persons  so unnerved was rob by his recent experiences that he determined to make no more stops  however he alighted at nightfall in the country and slept upon the sweet hay in a farmer's barn  but early the next morning before any one else was astir he resumed his journey and at precisely ten o'clock of this day which was saturday he completed his flying trip around the world by alighting unobserved upon the well-trimmed lawn of his own home     19  rob makes a resolution   when rob opened the front door he came face to face with nell who gave an exclamation of joy and threw herself into his arms  oh rob she cried i'm so glad you've come  we have all been dreadfully worried about you and mother   well what about mother inquired the boy anxiously as she paused  she's been very ill rob and the doctor said to-day that unless we heard from you soon he would not be able to save her life  the uncertainty about you is killing her  rob stood stock still all the eager joy of his return frozen into horror at the thought that he had caused his dear mother so much suffering  where is she nell he asked brokenly  in her room  come i'll take you to her  rob followed with beating heart and soon was clasped close to his mother's breast  oh my boy my dear boy she murmured and then for very joy and love she was unable to say more but held him tight and stroked his hair gently and kissed him again and again  rob said little except to promise that he would never again leave home without her full consent and knowledge  but in his mind he contrasted the love and comfort that now surrounded him with the lonely and unnatural life he had been leading and boy though he was in years a mighty resolution that would have been creditable to an experienced man took firm root in his heart  he was obliged to recount all his adventures to his mother and although he made light of the dangers he had passed through the story drew many sighs and shudders from her  when luncheon time arrived he met his father and mr joslyn took occasion to reprove his son in strong language for running away from home and leaving them filled with anxiety as to his fate  however when he saw how happy and improved in health his dear wife was at her boy's return and when he had listened to rob's manly confession of error and expressions of repentance he speedily forgave the culprit and treated him as genially as ever  of course the whole story had to be repeated his sisters listening this time with open eyes and ears and admiring their adventurous brother immensely  even mr joslyn could not help becoming profoundly interested but he took care not to show any pride he might feel in his son's achievements  when his father returned to his office rob went to his own bed-chamber and sat for a long time by the window in deep thought  when at last he aroused himself he found it was nearly four o'clock  the demon will be here presently he said with a thrill of aversion and i must be in the workshop to receive him  silently he stole to the foot of the attic stairs and then paused to listen  the house seemed very quiet but he could hear his mother's voice softly humming a cradle-song that she had sung to him when he was a baby  he had been nervous and unsettled and a little fearful until then but perhaps the sound of his mother's voice gave him courage for he boldly ascended the stairs and entered the workshop closing and locking the door behind him     20  the unhappy fate of the demon   again the atmosphere quickened and pulsed with accumulating vibrations again the boy found himself aroused to eager expectancy  there was a whirl in the air a crackling like distant musketry a flash of dazzling light and the demon stood before him for the third time  i give you greetings said he in a voice not unkindly  good afternoon mr demon answered the boy bowing gravely  i see you have returned safely from your trip continued the apparition cheerfully although at one time i thought you would be unable to escape  indeed unless i had knocked that tube from the rascally turk's hand as he clambered to the top of the wall i believe you would have been at the yarkand oasis yet either dead or alive as chance might determine  were you there asked rob  to be sure  and i recovered the tube for you without which you would have been helpless  but that is the only time i saw fit to interfere in any way  i'm afraid i did not get a chance to give many hints to inventors or scientists said rob  true and i have deeply regretted it replied the demon  but your unusual powers caused more astonishment and consternation than you perhaps imagined for many saw you whom you were too busy to notice as a result several able electricians are now thinking new thoughts along new lines and some of them may soon give these or similar inventions to the world  you are satisfied then asked rob  as to that returned the demon composedly i am not  but i have hopes that with the addition of the three marvelous devices i shall present you with to-day you will succeed in arousing so much popular interest in electrical inventions as to render me wholly satisfied with the result of this experiment  rob regarded the brilliant apparition with a solemn face but made no answer  no living person continued the demon has ever before been favored with such comforting devices for the preservation and extension of human life as yourself  you seem quite unappreciative it is true but since our connection i have come to realize that you are but an ordinary boy with many boyish limitations so i do not condemn your foolish actions too harshly  that is kind of you said rob  to prove my friendliness pursued the demon i have brought as the first of to-day's offerings this electro-magnetic restorer  you see it is shaped like a thin metal band and is to be worn upon the brow clasping at the back of the head  its virtues surpass those of either the fabulous 'fountain of youth' or the 'elixir of life' so vainly sought for in past ages  for its wearer will instantly become free from any bodily disease or pain and will enjoy perfect health and vigor  in truth so great are its powers that even the dead may be restored to life provided the blood has not yet chilled  in presenting you with this appliance i feel i am bestowing upon you the greatest blessing and most longed-for boon ever bequeathed of suffering humanity  here he held the slender dull-colored metallic band toward the boy  keep it said rob  the demon started and gave him an odd look  what did you say he asked  i told you to keep it answered rob  i don't want it  the demon staggered back as if he had been struck  don't want it he gasped  no i've had enough of your infernal inventions cried the boy with sudden anger  he unclasped the traveling machine from his wrist and laid it on the table beside the demon  there's the thing that's responsible for most of my troubles said he bitterly  what right has one person to fly through the air while all his fellow-creatures crawl over the earth's surface  and why should i be cut off from all the rest of the world because you have given me this confounded traveling machine  i didn't ask for it and i won't keep it a moment longer  give it to some one you hate more than you do me  the demon stared aghast and turned his glittering eyes wonderingly from rob to the traveling machine and back again as if to be sure he had heard and seen aright  and here are your food tablets continued the boy placing the box upon the table  i've only enjoyed one square meal since you gave them to me  they're all right to preserve life of course and answer the purpose for which they were made but i don't believe nature ever intended us to exist upon such things or we wouldn't have the sense of taste which enables us to enjoy natural food  as long as i'm a human being i'm going to eat like a human being so i've consumed my last electrical concentrated food tablet and don't you forget it  the demon sank into a chair nerveless and limp but still staring fearfully at the boy  and there's another of your unnatural devices said rob putting the automatic record of events upon the table beside the other things what right have you to capture vibrations that radiate from private and secret actions and discover them to others who have no business to know them  this would be a fine world if every body could peep into every one else's affairs wouldn't it  and here is your character marker  nice thing for a decent person to own isn't it  any one who would take advantage of such a sneaking invention as that would be worse than a thief  oh i've used them of course and i ought to be spanked for having been so mean and underhanded but i'll never be guilty of looking through them again  the demon's face was frowning and indignant  he made a motion to rise but thought better of it and sank back in his chair  as for the garment of protection resumed the boy after a pause i've worn it for the last time and here it is at your service  i'll put the electric tube with it  not that these are such very bad things in themselves but i'll have none of your magical contrivances  i'll say this however  if all armies were equipped with electrical tubes instead of guns and swords the world would be spared a lot of misery and unnecessary bloodshed  perhaps in time but that time hasn't arrived yet  you might have hastened it said the demon sternly if you had been wise enough to use your powers properly  that's just it answered rob  i'm not wise enough  nor is the majority of mankind wise enough to use such inventions as yours unselfishly and for the good of the world  if people were better and every one had an equal show it would be different  for some moments the demon sat quietly thinking  finally the frown left his face and he said with animation   i have other inventions which you may use without any such qualms of conscience  the electro-magnetic restorer i offered you would be a great boon to your race and could not possibly do harm  and besides this i have brought you what i call the illimitable communicator  it is a simple electric device which will enable you wherever you may be to converse with people in any part of the world without the use of such crude connections as wires  in fact you may   stop cried rob  it is useless for you to describe it because i'll have nothing more to do with you or your inventions  i have given them a fair trial and they've got me into all sorts of trouble and made all my friends miserable  if i was some high-up scientist it would be different but i'm just a common boy and i don't want to be anything else  but your duty  began the demon  my duty i owe to myself and to my family interrupted rob  i have never cultivated science more than to fool with some simple electrical experiments so i owe nothing to either science or the demon of electricity so far as i can see  but consider remonstrated the demon rising to his feet and speaking in a pleading voice consider the years that must elapse before any one else is likely to strike the master key  and in the meanwhile consider my helpless position cut off from all interest in the world while i have such wonderful inventions on my hands for the benefit of mankind  if you have no love for science or for the advancement of civilization do have some consideration for your fellow-creatures and for me  if my fellow-creatures would have as much trouble with your electrical inventions as i had i am doing them a service by depriving them of your devices said the boy  as for yourself i've no fault to find with you personally  you're a very decent sort of demon and i've no doubt you mean well but there's something wrong about our present combination i'm sure  it isn't natural  the demon made a gesture of despair  why oh why did not some intelligent person strike the master key he moaned  that's it exclaimed rob  i believe that's the root of the whole evil  what is inquired the demon stupidly  the fact that an intelligent person did not strike the master key you don't seem to understand  well i'll explain  you're the demon of electricity aren't you  i am said the other drawing himself up proudly  your mission is to obey the commands of whoever is able to strike the master key of electricity  that is true  i once read in a book that all things are regulated by exact laws of nature  if that is so you probably owe your existence to those laws the demon nodded  doubtless it was intended that when mankind became intelligent enough and advanced enough to strike the master key you and all your devices would not only be necessary and acceptable to them but the world would be prepared for their general use  that seems reasonable doesn't it  perhaps so  yes it seems reasonable answered the demon thoughtfully  accidents are always liable to happen continued the boy  by accident the master key was struck long before the world of science was ready for it or for you  instead of considering it an accident and paying no attention to it you immediately appeared to me a mere boy and offered your services  i was very anxious to do something returned the demon evasively you've no idea how stupid it is for me to live invisible and unknown while all the time i have in my possession secrets of untold benefit to the world  well you'll have to keep cool and bide your time said rob  the world wasn't made in a minute and while civilization is going on at a pretty good pace we're not up to the demon of electricity yet  what shall i do groaned the apparition wringing his hands miserably oh what shall i do  go home and lie down replied rob sympathetically  take it easy and don't get rattled  nothing was every created without a use they say so your turn will come some day sure  i'm sorry for you old fellow but it's all your own fault  you are right exclaimed the demon striding up and down the room and causing thereby such a crackling of electricity in the air that rob's hair became rigid enough to stand on end  you are right and i must wait wait wait patiently and silently until my bonds are loosed by intelligence rather than chance  it is a dreary fate  but i must wait i must wait i must wait  i'm glad you've come to your senses remarked rob drily  so if you've nothing more to say   no i have nothing more to say  there is nothing more to say  you and i are two  we should never had met retorted the demon showing great excitement  oh i didn't seek your acquaintance said rob  but i've tried to treat you decently and i've no fault to find with you except that you forgot you were a slave and tried to be a master  the demon did not reply  he was busily forcing the various electrical devices that rob had relinquished into the pockets of his fiery jacket  finally he turned with an abrupt movement  good-by he cried  when mortal eyes next behold me they will be those of one fit to command my services  as for you your days will be passed in obscurity and your name be unknown to fame good-by forever  the room filled with a flash of white light so like a sheet of lightning that the boy went reeling backwards half stunned and blinded by its dazzling intensity  when he recovered himself the demon of electricity had disappeared   rob's heart was very light as he left the workshop and made his way down the attic stairs  some people might think i was a fool to give up those electrical inventions he reflected but i'm one of those persons who know when they've had enough  it strikes me the fool is the fellow who can't learn a lesson  i've learned mine all right  it's no fun being a century ahead of the times "@"The Master Key"@"L.Frank Baum"

    introduction   folklore legends myths and fairy tales have followed childhood through the ages for every healthy youngster has a wholesome and instinctive love for stories fantastic marvelous and manifestly unreal the winged fairies of grimm and andersen have brought more happiness to childish hearts than all other human creations  yet the old time fairy tale having served for generations may now be classed as historical in the children’s library for the time has come for a series of newer wonder tales in which the stereotyped genie dwarf and fairy are eliminated together with all the horrible and blood-curdling incidents devised by their authors to point a fearsome moral to each tale modern education includes morality therefore the modern child seeks only entertainment in its wonder tales and gladly dispenses with all disagreeable incident  having this thought in mind the story of the wonderful wizard of oz was written solely to please children of today it aspires to being a modernized fairy tale in which the wonderment and joy are retained and the heartaches and nightmares are left out  l frank baum chicago april 1900    the wonderful wizard of oz     chapter i the cyclone   dorothy lived in the midst of the great kansas prairies with uncle henry who was a farmer and aunt em who was the farmer’s wife their house was small for the lumber to build it had to be carried by wagon many miles there were four walls a floor and a roof which made one room and this room contained a rusty looking cookstove a cupboard for the dishes a table three or four chairs and the beds uncle henry and aunt em had a big bed in one corner and dorothy a little bed in another corner there was no garret at all and no cellar—except a small hole dug in the ground called a cyclone cellar where the family could go in case one of those great whirlwinds arose mighty enough to crush any building in its path it was reached by a trap door in the middle of the floor from which a ladder led down into the small dark hole  when dorothy stood in the doorway and looked around she could see nothing but the great gray prairie on every side not a tree nor a house broke the broad sweep of flat country that reached to the edge of the sky in all directions the sun had baked the plowed land into a gray mass with little cracks running through it even the grass was not green for the sun had burned the tops of the long blades until they were the same gray color to be seen everywhere once the house had been painted but the sun blistered the paint and the rains washed it away and now the house was as dull and gray as everything else  when aunt em came there to live she was a young pretty wife the sun and wind had changed her too they had taken the sparkle from her eyes and left them a sober gray they had taken the red from her cheeks and lips and they were gray also she was thin and gaunt and never smiled now when dorothy who was an orphan first came to her aunt em had been so startled by the child’s laughter that she would scream and press her hand upon her heart whenever dorothy’s merry voice reached her ears and she still looked at the little girl with wonder that she could find anything to laugh at  uncle henry never laughed he worked hard from morning till night and did not know what joy was he was gray also from his long beard to his rough boots and he looked stern and solemn and rarely spoke  it was toto that made dorothy laugh and saved her from growing as gray as her other surroundings toto was not gray he was a little black dog with long silky hair and small black eyes that twinkled merrily on either side of his funny wee nose toto played all day long and dorothy played with him and loved him dearly  today however they were not playing uncle henry sat upon the doorstep and looked anxiously at the sky which was even grayer than usual dorothy stood in the door with toto in her arms and looked at the sky too aunt em was washing the dishes  from the far north they heard a low wail of the wind and uncle henry and dorothy could see where the long grass bowed in waves before the coming storm there now came a sharp whistling in the air from the south and as they turned their eyes that way they saw ripples in the grass coming from that direction also  suddenly uncle henry stood up  there’s a cyclone coming em he called to his wife i’ll go look after the stock then he ran toward the sheds where the cows and horses were kept  aunt em dropped her work and came to the door one glance told her of the danger close at hand  quick dorothy she screamed run for the cellar  toto jumped out of dorothy’s arms and hid under the bed and the girl started to get him aunt em badly frightened threw open the trap door in the floor and climbed down the ladder into the small dark hole dorothy caught toto at last and started to follow her aunt when she was halfway across the room there came a great shriek from the wind and the house shook so hard that she lost her footing and sat down suddenly upon the floor  then a strange thing happened  the house whirled around two or three times and rose slowly through the air dorothy felt as if she were going up in a balloon  the north and south winds met where the house stood and made it the exact center of the cyclone in the middle of a cyclone the air is generally still but the great pressure of the wind on every side of the house raised it up higher and higher until it was at the very top of the cyclone and there it remained and was carried miles and miles away as easily as you could carry a feather  it was very dark and the wind howled horribly around her but dorothy found she was riding quite easily after the first few whirls around and one other time when the house tipped badly she felt as if she were being rocked gently like a baby in a cradle  toto did not like it he ran about the room now here now there barking loudly but dorothy sat quite still on the floor and waited to see what would happen  once toto got too near the open trap door and fell in and at first the little girl thought she had lost him but soon she saw one of his ears sticking up through the hole for the strong pressure of the air was keeping him up so that he could not fall she crept to the hole caught toto by the ear and dragged him into the room again afterward closing the trap door so that no more accidents could happen  hour after hour passed away and slowly dorothy got over her fright but she felt quite lonely and the wind shrieked so loudly all about her that she nearly became deaf at first she had wondered if she would be dashed to pieces when the house fell again but as the hours passed and nothing terrible happened she stopped worrying and resolved to wait calmly and see what the future would bring at last she crawled over the swaying floor to her bed and lay down upon it and toto followed and lay down beside her  in spite of the swaying of the house and the wailing of the wind dorothy soon closed her eyes and fell fast asleep     chapter ii the council with the munchkins   she was awakened by a shock so sudden and severe that if dorothy had not been lying on the soft bed she might have been hurt as it was the jar made her catch her breath and wonder what had happened and toto put his cold little nose into her face and whined dismally dorothy sat up and noticed that the house was not moving nor was it dark for the bright sunshine came in at the window flooding the little room she sprang from her bed and with toto at her heels ran and opened the door  the little girl gave a cry of amazement and looked about her her eyes growing bigger and bigger at the wonderful sights she saw  the cyclone had set the house down very gently—for a cyclone—in the midst of a country of marvelous beauty there were lovely patches of greensward all about with stately trees bearing rich and luscious fruits banks of gorgeous flowers were on every hand and birds with rare and brilliant plumage sang and fluttered in the trees and bushes a little way off was a small brook rushing and sparkling along between green banks and murmuring in a voice very grateful to a little girl who had lived so long on the dry gray prairies  while she stood looking eagerly at the strange and beautiful sights she noticed coming toward her a group of the queerest people she had ever seen they were not as big as the grown folk she had always been used to but neither were they very small in fact they seemed about as tall as dorothy who was a well-grown child for her age although they were so far as looks go many years older  three were men and one a woman and all were oddly dressed they wore round hats that rose to a small point a foot above their heads with little bells around the brims that tinkled sweetly as they moved the hats of the men were blue the little woman’s hat was white and she wore a white gown that hung in pleats from her shoulders over it were sprinkled little stars that glistened in the sun like diamonds the men were dressed in blue of the same shade as their hats and wore well-polished boots with a deep roll of blue at the tops the men dorothy thought were about as old as uncle henry for two of them had beards but the little woman was doubtless much older her face was covered with wrinkles her hair was nearly white and she walked rather stiffly  when these people drew near the house where dorothy was standing in the doorway they paused and whispered among themselves as if afraid to come farther but the little old woman walked up to dorothy made a low bow and said in a sweet voice   you are welcome most noble sorceress to the land of the munchkins we are so grateful to you for having killed the wicked witch of the east and for setting our people free from bondage  dorothy listened to this speech with wonder what could the little woman possibly mean by calling her a sorceress and saying she had killed the wicked witch of the east dorothy was an innocent harmless little girl who had been carried by a cyclone many miles from home and she had never killed anything in all her life  but the little woman evidently expected her to answer so dorothy said with hesitation you are very kind but there must be some mistake i have not killed anything  your house did anyway replied the little old woman with a laugh and that is the same thing see she continued pointing to the corner of the house there are her two feet still sticking out from under a block of wood  dorothy looked and gave a little cry of fright there indeed just under the corner of the great beam the house rested on two feet were sticking out shod in silver shoes with pointed toes  oh dear oh dear cried dorothy clasping her hands together in dismay the house must have fallen on her whatever shall we do  there is nothing to be done said the little woman calmly  but who was she asked dorothy  she was the wicked witch of the east as i said answered the little woman she has held all the munchkins in bondage for many years making them slave for her night and day now they are all set free and are grateful to you for the favor  who are the munchkins inquired dorothy  they are the people who live in this land of the east where the wicked witch ruled  are you a munchkin asked dorothy  no but i am their friend although i live in the land of the north when they saw the witch of the east was dead the munchkins sent a swift messenger to me and i came at once i am the witch of the north  oh gracious cried dorothy are you a real witch  yes indeed answered the little woman but i am a good witch and the people love me i am not as powerful as the wicked witch was who ruled here or i should have set the people free myself  but i thought all witches were wicked said the girl who was half frightened at facing a real witch  oh no that is a great mistake there were only four witches in all the land of oz and two of them those who live in the north and the south are good witches i know this is true for i am one of them myself and cannot be mistaken those who dwelt in the east and the west were indeed wicked witches but now that you have killed one of them there is but one wicked witch in all the land of oz—the one who lives in the west  but said dorothy after a moment’s thought aunt em has told me that the witches were all dead—years and years ago  who is aunt em inquired the little old woman  she is my aunt who lives in kansas where i came from  the witch of the north seemed to think for a time with her head bowed and her eyes upon the ground then she looked up and said i do not know where kansas is for i have never heard that country mentioned before but tell me is it a civilized country  oh yes replied dorothy  then that accounts for it in the civilized countries i believe there are no witches left nor wizards nor sorceresses nor magicians but you see the land of oz has never been civilized for we are cut off from all the rest of the world therefore we still have witches and wizards amongst us  who are the wizards asked dorothy  oz himself is the great wizard answered the witch sinking her voice to a whisper he is more powerful than all the rest of us together he lives in the city of emeralds  dorothy was going to ask another question but just then the munchkins who had been standing silently by gave a loud shout and pointed to the corner of the house where the wicked witch had been lying  what is it asked the little old woman and looked and began to laugh the feet of the dead witch had disappeared entirely and nothing was left but the silver shoes  she was so old explained the witch of the north that she dried up quickly in the sun that is the end of her but the silver shoes are yours and you shall have them to wear she reached down and picked up the shoes and after shaking the dust out of them handed them to dorothy  the witch of the east was proud of those silver shoes said one of the munchkins and there is some charm connected with them but what it is we never knew  dorothy carried the shoes into the house and placed them on the table then she came out again to the munchkins and said   i am anxious to get back to my aunt and uncle for i am sure they will worry about me can you help me find my way  the munchkins and the witch first looked at one another and then at dorothy and then shook their heads  at the east not far from here said one there is a great desert and none could live to cross it  it is the same at the south said another for i have been there and seen it the south is the country of the quadlings  i am told said the third man that it is the same at the west and that country where the winkies live is ruled by the wicked witch of the west who would make you her slave if you passed her way  the north is my home said the old lady and at its edge is the same great desert that surrounds this land of oz i’m afraid my dear you will have to live with us  dorothy began to sob at this for she felt lonely among all these strange people her tears seemed to grieve the kind-hearted munchkins for they immediately took out their handkerchiefs and began to weep also as for the little old woman she took off her cap and balanced the point on the end of her nose while she counted one two three in a solemn voice at once the cap changed to a slate on which was written in big white chalk marks   let dorothy go to the city of emeralds   the little old woman took the slate from her nose and having read the words on it asked is your name dorothy my dear  yes answered the child looking up and drying her tears  then you must go to the city of emeralds perhaps oz will help you  where is this city asked dorothy  it is exactly in the center of the country and is ruled by oz the great wizard i told you of  is he a good man inquired the girl anxiously  he is a good wizard whether he is a man or not i cannot tell for i have never seen him  how can i get there asked dorothy  you must walk it is a long journey through a country that is sometimes pleasant and sometimes dark and terrible however i will use all the magic arts i know of to keep you from harm  won’t you go with me pleaded the girl who had begun to look upon the little old woman as her only friend  no i cannot do that she replied but i will give you my kiss and no one will dare injure a person who has been kissed by the witch of the north  she came close to dorothy and kissed her gently on the forehead where her lips touched the girl they left a round shining mark as dorothy found out soon after  the road to the city of emeralds is paved with yellow brick said the witch so you cannot miss it when you get to oz do not be afraid of him but tell your story and ask him to help you good-bye my dear  the three munchkins bowed low to her and wished her a pleasant journey after which they walked away through the trees the witch gave dorothy a friendly little nod whirled around on her left heel three times and straightway disappeared much to the surprise of little toto who barked after her loudly enough when she had gone because he had been afraid even to growl while she stood by  but dorothy knowing her to be a witch had expected her to disappear in just that way and was not surprised in the least     chapter iii how dorothy saved the scarecrow   when dorothy was left alone she began to feel hungry so she went to the cupboard and cut herself some bread which she spread with butter she gave some to toto and taking a pail from the shelf she carried it down to the little brook and filled it with clear sparkling water toto ran over to the trees and began to bark at the birds sitting there dorothy went to get him and saw such delicious fruit hanging from the branches that she gathered some of it finding it just what she wanted to help out her breakfast  then she went back to the house and having helped herself and toto to a good drink of the cool clear water she set about making ready for the journey to the city of emeralds  dorothy had only one other dress but that happened to be clean and was hanging on a peg beside her bed it was gingham with checks of white and blue and although the blue was somewhat faded with many washings it was still a pretty frock the girl washed herself carefully dressed herself in the clean gingham and tied her pink sunbonnet on her head she took a little basket and filled it with bread from the cupboard laying a white cloth over the top then she looked down at her feet and noticed how old and worn her shoes were  they surely will never do for a long journey toto she said and toto looked up into her face with his little black eyes and wagged his tail to show he knew what she meant  at that moment dorothy saw lying on the table the silver shoes that had belonged to the witch of the east  i wonder if they will fit me she said to toto they would be just the thing to take a long walk in for they could not wear out  she took off her old leather shoes and tried on the silver ones which fitted her as well as if they had been made for her  finally she picked up her basket  come along toto she said we will go to the emerald city and ask the great oz how to get back to kansas again  she closed the door locked it and put the key carefully in the pocket of her dress and so with toto trotting along soberly behind her she started on her journey  there were several roads nearby but it did not take her long to find the one paved with yellow bricks within a short time she was walking briskly toward the emerald city her silver shoes tinkling merrily on the hard yellow road-bed the sun shone bright and the birds sang sweetly and dorothy did not feel nearly so bad as you might think a little girl would who had been suddenly whisked away from her own country and set down in the midst of a strange land  she was surprised as she walked along to see how pretty the country was about her there were neat fences at the sides of the road painted a dainty blue color and beyond them were fields of grain and vegetables in abundance evidently the munchkins were good farmers and able to raise large crops once in a while she would pass a house and the people came out to look at her and bow low as she went by for everyone knew she had been the means of destroying the wicked witch and setting them free from bondage the houses of the munchkins were odd-looking dwellings for each was round with a big dome for a roof all were painted blue for in this country of the east blue was the favorite color  toward evening when dorothy was tired with her long walk and began to wonder where she should pass the night she came to a house rather larger than the rest on the green lawn before it many men and women were dancing five little fiddlers played as loudly as possible and the people were laughing and singing while a big table near by was loaded with delicious fruits and nuts pies and cakes and many other good things to eat  the people greeted dorothy kindly and invited her to supper and to pass the night with them for this was the home of one of the richest munchkins in the land and his friends were gathered with him to celebrate their freedom from the bondage of the wicked witch  dorothy ate a hearty supper and was waited upon by the rich munchkin himself whose name was boq then she sat upon a settee and watched the people dance  when boq saw her silver shoes he said you must be a great sorceress  why asked the girl  because you wear silver shoes and have killed the wicked witch besides you have white in your frock and only witches and sorceresses wear white  my dress is blue and white checked said dorothy smoothing out the wrinkles in it  it is kind of you to wear that said boq blue is the color of the munchkins and white is the witch color so we know you are a friendly witch  dorothy did not know what to say to this for all the people seemed to think her a witch and she knew very well she was only an ordinary little girl who had come by the chance of a cyclone into a strange land  when she had tired watching the dancing boq led her into the house where he gave her a room with a pretty bed in it the sheets were made of blue cloth and dorothy slept soundly in them till morning with toto curled up on the blue rug beside her  she ate a hearty breakfast and watched a wee munchkin baby who played with toto and pulled his tail and crowed and laughed in a way that greatly amused dorothy toto was a fine curiosity to all the people for they had never seen a dog before  how far is it to the emerald city the girl asked  i do not know answered boq gravely for i have never been there it is better for people to keep away from oz unless they have business with him but it is a long way to the emerald city and it will take you many days the country here is rich and pleasant but you must pass through rough and dangerous places before you reach the end of your journey  this worried dorothy a little but she knew that only the great oz could help her get to kansas again so she bravely resolved not to turn back  she bade her friends good-bye and again started along the road of yellow brick when she had gone several miles she thought she would stop to rest and so climbed to the top of the fence beside the road and sat down there was a great cornfield beyond the fence and not far away she saw a scarecrow placed high on a pole to keep the birds from the ripe corn  dorothy leaned her chin upon her hand and gazed thoughtfully at the scarecrow its head was a small sack stuffed with straw with eyes nose and mouth painted on it to represent a face an old pointed blue hat that had belonged to some munchkin was perched on his head and the rest of the figure was a blue suit of clothes worn and faded which had also been stuffed with straw on the feet were some old boots with blue tops such as every man wore in this country and the figure was raised above the stalks of corn by means of the pole stuck up its back  while dorothy was looking earnestly into the queer painted face of the scarecrow she was surprised to see one of the eyes slowly wink at her she thought she must have been mistaken at first for none of the scarecrows in kansas ever wink but presently the figure nodded its head to her in a friendly way then she climbed down from the fence and walked up to it while toto ran around the pole and barked  good day said the scarecrow in a rather husky voice  did you speak asked the girl in wonder  certainly answered the scarecrow how do you do  i’m pretty well thank you replied dorothy politely how do you do  i’m not feeling well said the scarecrow with a smile for it is very tedious being perched up here night and day to scare away crows  can’t you get down asked dorothy  no for this pole is stuck up my back if you will please take away the pole i shall be greatly obliged to you  dorothy reached up both arms and lifted the figure off the pole for being stuffed with straw it was quite light  thank you very much said the scarecrow when he had been set down on the ground i feel like a new man  dorothy was puzzled at this for it sounded queer to hear a stuffed man speak and to see him bow and walk along beside her  who are you asked the scarecrow when he had stretched himself and yawned and where are you going  my name is dorothy said the girl and i am going to the emerald city to ask the great oz to send me back to kansas  where is the emerald city he inquired and who is oz  why don’t you know she returned in surprise  no indeed i don’t know anything you see i am stuffed so i have no brains at all he answered sadly  oh said dorothy i’m awfully sorry for you  do you think he asked if i go to the emerald city with you that oz would give me some brains  i cannot tell she returned but you may come with me if you like if oz will not give you any brains you will be no worse off than you are now  that is true said the scarecrow you see he continued confidentially i don’t mind my legs and arms and body being stuffed because i cannot get hurt if anyone treads on my toes or sticks a pin into me it doesn’t matter for i can’t feel it but i do not want people to call me a fool and if my head stays stuffed with straw instead of with brains as yours is how am i ever to know anything  i understand how you feel said the little girl who was truly sorry for him if you will come with me i’ll ask oz to do all he can for you  thank you he answered gratefully  they walked back to the road dorothy helped him over the fence and they started along the path of yellow brick for the emerald city  toto did not like this addition to the party at first he smelled around the stuffed man as if he suspected there might be a nest of rats in the straw and he often growled in an unfriendly way at the scarecrow  don’t mind toto said dorothy to her new friend he never bites  oh i’m not afraid replied the scarecrow he can’t hurt the straw do let me carry that basket for you i shall not mind it for i can’t get tired i’ll tell you a secret he continued as he walked along there is only one thing in the world i am afraid of  what is that asked dorothy the munchkin farmer who made you  no answered the scarecrow it’s a lighted match     chapter iv the road through the forest   after a few hours the road began to be rough and the walking grew so difficult that the scarecrow often stumbled over the yellow bricks which were here very uneven sometimes indeed they were broken or missing altogether leaving holes that toto jumped across and dorothy walked around as for the scarecrow having no brains he walked straight ahead and so stepped into the holes and fell at full length on the hard bricks it never hurt him however and dorothy would pick him up and set him upon his feet again while he joined her in laughing merrily at his own mishap  the farms were not nearly so well cared for here as they were farther back there were fewer houses and fewer fruit trees and the farther they went the more dismal and lonesome the country became  at noon they sat down by the roadside near a little brook and dorothy opened her basket and got out some bread she offered a piece to the scarecrow but he refused  i am never hungry he said and it is a lucky thing i am not for my mouth is only painted and if i should cut a hole in it so i could eat the straw i am stuffed with would come out and that would spoil the shape of my head  dorothy saw at once that this was true so she only nodded and went on eating her bread  tell me something about yourself and the country you came from said the scarecrow when she had finished her dinner so she told him all about kansas and how gray everything was there and how the cyclone had carried her to this queer land of oz  the scarecrow listened carefully and said i cannot understand why you should wish to leave this beautiful country and go back to the dry gray place you call kansas  that is because you have no brains answered the girl no matter how dreary and gray our homes are we people of flesh and blood would rather live there than in any other country be it ever so beautiful there is no place like home  the scarecrow sighed  of course i cannot understand it he said if your heads were stuffed with straw like mine you would probably all live in the beautiful places and then kansas would have no people at all it is fortunate for kansas that you have brains  won’t you tell me a story while we are resting asked the child  the scarecrow looked at her reproachfully and answered   my life has been so short that i really know nothing whatever i was only made day before yesterday what happened in the world before that time is all unknown to me luckily when the farmer made my head one of the first things he did was to paint my ears so that i heard what was going on there was another munchkin with him and the first thing i heard was the farmer saying ‘how do you like those ears’  ‘they aren’t straight’ answered the other  ‘never mind’ said the farmer ‘they are ears just the same’ which was true enough  ‘now i’ll make the eyes’ said the farmer so he painted my right eye and as soon as it was finished i found myself looking at him and at everything around me with a great deal of curiosity for this was my first glimpse of the world  ‘that’s a rather pretty eye’ remarked the munchkin who was watching the farmer ‘blue paint is just the color for eyes’  ‘i think i’ll make the other a little bigger’ said the farmer and when the second eye was done i could see much better than before then he made my nose and my mouth but i did not speak because at that time i didn’t know what a mouth was for i had the fun of watching them make my body and my arms and legs and when they fastened on my head at last i felt very proud for i thought i was just as good a man as anyone  ‘this fellow will scare the crows fast enough’ said the farmer ‘he looks just like a man’  ‘why he is a man’ said the other and i quite agreed with him the farmer carried me under his arm to the cornfield and set me up on a tall stick where you found me he and his friend soon after walked away and left me alone  i did not like to be deserted this way so i tried to walk after them but my feet would not touch the ground and i was forced to stay on that pole it was a lonely life to lead for i had nothing to think of having been made such a little while before many crows and other birds flew into the cornfield but as soon as they saw me they flew away again thinking i was a munchkin and this pleased me and made me feel that i was quite an important person by and by an old crow flew near me and after looking at me carefully he perched upon my shoulder and said   ‘i wonder if that farmer thought to fool me in this clumsy manner any crow of sense could see that you are only stuffed with straw’ then he hopped down at my feet and ate all the corn he wanted the other birds seeing he was not harmed by me came to eat the corn too so in a short time there was a great flock of them about me  i felt sad at this for it showed i was not such a good scarecrow after all but the old crow comforted me saying ‘if you only had brains in your head you would be as good a man as any of them and a better man than some of them brains are the only things worth having in this world no matter whether one is a crow or a man’  after the crows had gone i thought this over and decided i would try hard to get some brains by good luck you came along and pulled me off the stake and from what you say i am sure the great oz will give me brains as soon as we get to the emerald city  i hope so said dorothy earnestly since you seem anxious to have them  oh yes i am anxious returned the scarecrow it is such an uncomfortable feeling to know one is a fool  well said the girl let us go and she handed the basket to the scarecrow  there were no fences at all by the roadside now and the land was rough and untilled toward evening they came to a great forest where the trees grew so big and close together that their branches met over the road of yellow brick it was almost dark under the trees for the branches shut out the daylight but the travelers did not stop and went on into the forest  if this road goes in it must come out said the scarecrow and as the emerald city is at the other end of the road we must go wherever it leads us  anyone would know that said dorothy  certainly that is why i know it returned the scarecrow if it required brains to figure it out i never should have said it  after an hour or so the light faded away and they found themselves stumbling along in the darkness dorothy could not see at all but toto could for some dogs see very well in the dark and the scarecrow declared he could see as well as by day so she took hold of his arm and managed to get along fairly well  if you see any house or any place where we can pass the night she said you must tell me for it is very uncomfortable walking in the dark  soon after the scarecrow stopped  i see a little cottage at the right of us he said built of logs and branches shall we go there  yes indeed answered the child i am all tired out  so the scarecrow led her through the trees until they reached the cottage and dorothy entered and found a bed of dried leaves in one corner she lay down at once and with toto beside her soon fell into a sound sleep the scarecrow who was never tired stood up in another corner and waited patiently until morning came     chapter v the rescue of the tin woodman   when dorothy awoke the sun was shining through the trees and toto had long been out chasing birds around him and squirrels she sat up and looked around her there was the scarecrow still standing patiently in his corner waiting for her  we must go and search for water she said to him  why do you want water he asked  to wash my face clean after the dust of the road and to drink so the dry bread will not stick in my throat  it must be inconvenient to be made of flesh said the scarecrow thoughtfully for you must sleep and eat and drink however you have brains and it is worth a lot of bother to be able to think properly  they left the cottage and walked through the trees until they found a little spring of clear water where dorothy drank and bathed and ate her breakfast she saw there was not much bread left in the basket and the girl was thankful the scarecrow did not have to eat anything for there was scarcely enough for herself and toto for the day  when she had finished her meal and was about to go back to the road of yellow brick she was startled to hear a deep groan near by  what was that she asked timidly  i cannot imagine replied the scarecrow but we can go and see  just then another groan reached their ears and the sound seemed to come from behind them they turned and walked through the forest a few steps when dorothy discovered something shining in a ray of sunshine that fell between the trees she ran to the place and then stopped short with a little cry of surprise  one of the big trees had been partly chopped through and standing beside it with an uplifted axe in his hands was a man made entirely of tin his head and arms and legs were jointed upon his body but he stood perfectly motionless as if he could not stir at all  dorothy looked at him in amazement and so did the scarecrow while toto barked sharply and made a snap at the tin legs which hurt his teeth  did you groan asked dorothy  yes answered the tin man i did i’ve been groaning for more than a year and no one has ever heard me before or come to help me  what can i do for you she inquired softly for she was moved by the sad voice in which the man spoke  get an oil-can and oil my joints he answered they are rusted so badly that i cannot move them at all if i am well oiled i shall soon be all right again you will find an oil-can on a shelf in my cottage  dorothy at once ran back to the cottage and found the oil-can and then she returned and asked anxiously where are your joints  oil my neck first replied the tin woodman so she oiled it and as it was quite badly rusted the scarecrow took hold of the tin head and moved it gently from side to side until it worked freely and then the man could turn it himself  now oil the joints in my arms he said and dorothy oiled them and the scarecrow bent them carefully until they were quite free from rust and as good as new  the tin woodman gave a sigh of satisfaction and lowered his axe which he leaned against the tree  this is a great comfort he said i have been holding that axe in the air ever since i rusted and i’m glad to be able to put it down at last now if you will oil the joints of my legs i shall be all right once more  so they oiled his legs until he could move them freely and he thanked them again and again for his release for he seemed a very polite creature and very grateful  i might have stood there always if you had not come along he said so you have certainly saved my life how did you happen to be here  we are on our way to the emerald city to see the great oz she answered and we stopped at your cottage to pass the night  why do you wish to see oz he asked  i want him to send me back to kansas and the scarecrow wants him to put a few brains into his head she replied  the tin woodman appeared to think deeply for a moment then he said   do you suppose oz could give me a heart  why i guess so dorothy answered it would be as easy as to give the scarecrow brains  true the tin woodman returned so if you will allow me to join your party i will also go to the emerald city and ask oz to help me  come along said the scarecrow heartily and dorothy added that she would be pleased to have his company so the tin woodman shouldered his axe and they all passed through the forest until they came to the road that was paved with yellow brick  the tin woodman had asked dorothy to put the oil-can in her basket for he said if i should get caught in the rain and rust again i would need the oil-can badly  it was a bit of good luck to have their new comrade join the party for soon after they had begun their journey again they came to a place where the trees and branches grew so thick over the road that the travelers could not pass but the tin woodman set to work with his axe and chopped so well that soon he cleared a passage for the entire party  dorothy was thinking so earnestly as they walked along that she did not notice when the scarecrow stumbled into a hole and rolled over to the side of the road indeed he was obliged to call to her to help him up again  why didn’t you walk around the hole asked the tin woodman  i don’t know enough replied the scarecrow cheerfully my head is stuffed with straw you know and that is why i am going to oz to ask him for some brains  oh i see said the tin woodman but after all brains are not the best things in the world  have you any inquired the scarecrow  no my head is quite empty answered the woodman but once i had brains and a heart also so having tried them both i should much rather have a heart  and why is that asked the scarecrow  i will tell you my story and then you will know  so while they were walking through the forest the tin woodman told the following story   i was born the son of a woodman who chopped down trees in the forest and sold the wood for a living when i grew up i too became a wood-chopper and after my father died i took care of my old mother as long as she lived then i made up my mind that instead of living alone i would marry so that i might not become lonely  there was one of the munchkin girls who was so beautiful that i soon grew to love her with all my heart she on her part promised to marry me as soon as i could earn enough money to build a better house for her so i set to work harder than ever but the girl lived with an old woman who did not want her to marry anyone for she was so lazy she wished the girl to remain with her and do the cooking and the housework so the old woman went to the wicked witch of the east and promised her two sheep and a cow if she would prevent the marriage thereupon the wicked witch enchanted my axe and when i was chopping away at my best one day for i was anxious to get the new house and my wife as soon as possible the axe slipped all at once and cut off my left leg  this at first seemed a great misfortune for i knew a one-legged man could not do very well as a wood-chopper so i went to a tinsmith and had him make me a new leg out of tin the leg worked very well once i was used to it but my action angered the wicked witch of the east for she had promised the old woman i should not marry the pretty munchkin girl when i began chopping again my axe slipped and cut off my right leg again i went to the tinsmith and again he made me a leg out of tin after this the enchanted axe cut off my arms one after the other but nothing daunted i had them replaced with tin ones the wicked witch then made the axe slip and cut off my head and at first i thought that was the end of me but the tinsmith happened to come along and he made me a new head out of tin  i thought i had beaten the wicked witch then and i worked harder than ever but i little knew how cruel my enemy could be she thought of a new way to kill my love for the beautiful munchkin maiden and made my axe slip again so that it cut right through my body splitting me into two halves once more the tinsmith came to my help and made me a body of tin fastening my tin arms and legs and head to it by means of joints so that i could move around as well as ever but alas i had now no heart so that i lost all my love for the munchkin girl and did not care whether i married her or not i suppose she is still living with the old woman waiting for me to come after her  my body shone so brightly in the sun that i felt very proud of it and it did not matter now if my axe slipped for it could not cut me there was only one danger—that my joints would rust but i kept an oil-can in my cottage and took care to oil myself whenever i needed it however there came a day when i forgot to do this and being caught in a rainstorm before i thought of the danger my joints had rusted and i was left to stand in the woods until you came to help me it was a terrible thing to undergo but during the year i stood there i had time to think that the greatest loss i had known was the loss of my heart while i was in love i was the happiest man on earth but no one can love who has not a heart and so i am resolved to ask oz to give me one if he does i will go back to the munchkin maiden and marry her  both dorothy and the scarecrow had been greatly interested in the story of the tin woodman and now they knew why he was so anxious to get a new heart  all the same said the scarecrow i shall ask for brains instead of a heart for a fool would not know what to do with a heart if he had one  i shall take the heart returned the tin woodman for brains do not make one happy and happiness is the best thing in the world  dorothy did not say anything for she was puzzled to know which of her two friends was right and she decided if she could only get back to kansas and aunt em it did not matter so much whether the woodman had no brains and the scarecrow no heart or each got what he wanted  what worried her most was that the bread was nearly gone and another meal for herself and toto would empty the basket to be sure neither the woodman nor the scarecrow ever ate anything but she was not made of tin nor straw and could not live unless she was fed     chapter vi the cowardly lion   all this time dorothy and her companions had been walking through the thick woods the road was still paved with yellow brick but these were much covered by dried branches and dead leaves from the trees and the walking was not at all good  there were few birds in this part of the forest for birds love the open country where there is plenty of sunshine but now and then there came a deep growl from some wild animal hidden among the trees these sounds made the little girl’s heart beat fast for she did not know what made them but toto knew and he walked close to dorothy’s side and did not even bark in return  how long will it be the child asked of the tin woodman before we are out of the forest  i cannot tell was the answer for i have never been to the emerald city but my father went there once when i was a boy and he said it was a long journey through a dangerous country although nearer to the city where oz dwells the country is beautiful but i am not afraid so long as i have my oil-can and nothing can hurt the scarecrow while you bear upon your forehead the mark of the good witch’s kiss and that will protect you from harm  but toto said the girl anxiously what will protect him  we must protect him ourselves if he is in danger replied the tin woodman  just as he spoke there came from the forest a terrible roar and the next moment a great lion bounded into the road with one blow of his paw he sent the scarecrow spinning over and over to the edge of the road and then he struck at the tin woodman with his sharp claws but to the lion’s surprise he could make no impression on the tin although the woodman fell over in the road and lay still  little toto now that he had an enemy to face ran barking toward the lion and the great beast had opened his mouth to bite the dog when dorothy fearing toto would be killed and heedless of danger rushed forward and slapped the lion upon his nose as hard as she could while she cried out   don’t you dare to bite toto you ought to be ashamed of yourself a big beast like you to bite a poor little dog  i didn’t bite him said the lion as he rubbed his nose with his paw where dorothy had hit it  no but you tried to she retorted you are nothing but a big coward  i know it said the lion hanging his head in shame i’ve always known it but how can i help it  i don’t know i’m sure to think of your striking a stuffed man like the poor scarecrow  is he stuffed asked the lion in surprise as he watched her pick up the scarecrow and set him upon his feet while she patted him into shape again  of course he’s stuffed replied dorothy who was still angry  that’s why he went over so easily remarked the lion it astonished me to see him whirl around so is the other one stuffed also  no said dorothy he’s made of tin and she helped the woodman up again  that’s why he nearly blunted my claws said the lion when they scratched against the tin it made a cold shiver run down my back what is that little animal you are so tender of  he is my dog toto answered dorothy  is he made of tin or stuffed asked the lion  neither he’s a—a—a meat dog said the girl  oh he’s a curious animal and seems remarkably small now that i look at him no one would think of biting such a little thing except a coward like me continued the lion sadly  what makes you a coward asked dorothy looking at the great beast in wonder for he was as big as a small horse  it’s a mystery replied the lion i suppose i was born that way all the other animals in the forest naturally expect me to be brave for the lion is everywhere thought to be the king of beasts i learned that if i roared very loudly every living thing was frightened and got out of my way whenever i’ve met a man i’ve been awfully scared but i just roared at him and he has always run away as fast as he could go if the elephants and the tigers and the bears had ever tried to fight me i should have run myself—i’m such a coward but just as soon as they hear me roar they all try to get away from me and of course i let them go  but that isn’t right the king of beasts shouldn’t be a coward said the scarecrow  i know it returned the lion wiping a tear from his eye with the tip of his tail it is my great sorrow and makes my life very unhappy but whenever there is danger my heart begins to beat fast  perhaps you have heart disease said the tin woodman  it may be said the lion  if you have continued the tin woodman you ought to be glad for it proves you have a heart for my part i have no heart so i cannot have heart disease  perhaps said the lion thoughtfully if i had no heart i should not be a coward  have you brains asked the scarecrow  i suppose so i’ve never looked to see replied the lion  i am going to the great oz to ask him to give me some remarked the scarecrow for my head is stuffed with straw  and i am going to ask him to give me a heart said the woodman  and i am going to ask him to send toto and me back to kansas added dorothy  do you think oz could give me courage asked the cowardly lion  just as easily as he could give me brains said the scarecrow  or give me a heart said the tin woodman  or send me back to kansas said dorothy  then if you don’t mind i’ll go with you said the lion for my life is simply unbearable without a bit of courage  you will be very welcome answered dorothy for you will help to keep away the other wild beasts it seems to me they must be more cowardly than you are if they allow you to scare them so easily  they really are said the lion but that doesn’t make me any braver and as long as i know myself to be a coward i shall be unhappy  so once more the little company set off upon the journey the lion walking with stately strides at dorothy’s side toto did not approve of this new comrade at first for he could not forget how nearly he had been crushed between the lion’s great jaws but after a time he became more at ease and presently toto and the cowardly lion had grown to be good friends  during the rest of that day there was no other adventure to mar the peace of their journey once indeed the tin woodman stepped upon a beetle that was crawling along the road and killed the poor little thing this made the tin woodman very unhappy for he was always careful not to hurt any living creature and as he walked along he wept several tears of sorrow and regret these tears ran slowly down his face and over the hinges of his jaw and there they rusted when dorothy presently asked him a question the tin woodman could not open his mouth for his jaws were tightly rusted together he became greatly frightened at this and made many motions to dorothy to relieve him but she could not understand the lion was also puzzled to know what was wrong but the scarecrow seized the oil-can from dorothy’s basket and oiled the woodman’s jaws so that after a few moments he could talk as well as before  this will serve me a lesson said he to look where i step for if i should kill another bug or beetle i should surely cry again and crying rusts my jaws so that i cannot speak  thereafter he walked very carefully with his eyes on the road and when he saw a tiny ant toiling by he would step over it so as not to harm it the tin woodman knew very well he had no heart and therefore he took great care never to be cruel or unkind to anything  you people with hearts he said have something to guide you and need never do wrong but i have no heart and so i must be very careful when oz gives me a heart of course i needn’t mind so much     chapter vii the journey to the great oz   they were obliged to camp out that night under a large tree in the forest for there were no houses near the tree made a good thick covering to protect them from the dew and the tin woodman chopped a great pile of wood with his axe and dorothy built a splendid fire that warmed her and made her feel less lonely she and toto ate the last of their bread and now she did not know what they would do for breakfast  if you wish said the lion i will go into the forest and kill a deer for you you can roast it by the fire since your tastes are so peculiar that you prefer cooked food and then you will have a very good breakfast  don’t please don’t begged the tin woodman i should certainly weep if you killed a poor deer and then my jaws would rust again  but the lion went away into the forest and found his own supper and no one ever knew what it was for he didn’t mention it and the scarecrow found a tree full of nuts and filled dorothy’s basket with them so that she would not be hungry for a long time she thought this was very kind and thoughtful of the scarecrow but she laughed heartily at the awkward way in which the poor creature picked up the nuts his padded hands were so clumsy and the nuts were so small that he dropped almost as many as he put in the basket but the scarecrow did not mind how long it took him to fill the basket for it enabled him to keep away from the fire as he feared a spark might get into his straw and burn him up so he kept a good distance away from the flames and only came near to cover dorothy with dry leaves when she lay down to sleep these kept her very snug and warm and she slept soundly until morning  when it was daylight the girl bathed her face in a little rippling brook and soon after they all started toward the emerald city  this was to be an eventful day for the travelers they had hardly been walking an hour when they saw before them a great ditch that crossed the road and divided the forest as far as they could see on either side it was a very wide ditch and when they crept up to the edge and looked into it they could see it was also very deep and there were many big jagged rocks at the bottom the sides were so steep that none of them could climb down and for a moment it seemed that their journey must end  what shall we do asked dorothy despairingly  i haven’t the faintest idea said the tin woodman and the lion shook his shaggy mane and looked thoughtful  but the scarecrow said we cannot fly that is certain neither can we climb down into this great ditch therefore if we cannot jump over it we must stop where we are  i think i could jump over it said the cowardly lion after measuring the distance carefully in his mind  then we are all right answered the scarecrow for you can carry us all over on your back one at a time  well i’ll try it said the lion who will go first  i will declared the scarecrow for if you found that you could not jump over the gulf dorothy would be killed or the tin woodman badly dented on the rocks below but if i am on your back it will not matter so much for the fall would not hurt me at all  i am terribly afraid of falling myself said the cowardly lion but i suppose there is nothing to do but try it so get on my back and we will make the attempt  the scarecrow sat upon the lion’s back and the big beast walked to the edge of the gulf and crouched down  why don’t you run and jump asked the scarecrow  because that isn’t the way we lions do these things he replied then giving a great spring he shot through the air and landed safely on the other side they were all greatly pleased to see how easily he did it and after the scarecrow had got down from his back the lion sprang across the ditch again  dorothy thought she would go next so she took toto in her arms and climbed on the lion’s back holding tightly to his mane with one hand the next moment it seemed as if she were flying through the air and then before she had time to think about it she was safe on the other side the lion went back a third time and got the tin woodman and then they all sat down for a few moments to give the beast a chance to rest for his great leaps had made his breath short and he panted like a big dog that has been running too long  they found the forest very thick on this side and it looked dark and gloomy after the lion had rested they started along the road of yellow brick silently wondering each in his own mind if ever they would come to the end of the woods and reach the bright sunshine again to add to their discomfort they soon heard strange noises in the depths of the forest and the lion whispered to them that it was in this part of the country that the kalidahs lived  what are the kalidahs asked the girl  they are monstrous beasts with bodies like bears and heads like tigers replied the lion and with claws so long and sharp that they could tear me in two as easily as i could kill toto i’m terribly afraid of the kalidahs  i’m not surprised that you are returned dorothy they must be dreadful beasts  the lion was about to reply when suddenly they came to another gulf across the road but this one was so broad and deep that the lion knew at once he could not leap across it  so they sat down to consider what they should do and after serious thought the scarecrow said   here is a great tree standing close to the ditch if the tin woodman can chop it down so that it will fall to the other side we can walk across it easily  that is a first-rate idea said the lion one would almost suspect you had brains in your head instead of straw  the woodman set to work at once and so sharp was his axe that the tree was soon chopped nearly through then the lion put his strong front legs against the tree and pushed with all his might and slowly the big tree tipped and fell with a crash across the ditch with its top branches on the other side  they had just started to cross this queer bridge when a sharp growl made them all look up and to their horror they saw running toward them two great beasts with bodies like bears and heads like tigers  they are the kalidahs said the cowardly lion beginning to tremble  quick cried the scarecrow let us cross over  so dorothy went first holding toto in her arms the tin woodman followed and the scarecrow came next the lion although he was certainly afraid turned to face the kalidahs and then he gave so loud and terrible a roar that dorothy screamed and the scarecrow fell over backward while even the fierce beasts stopped short and looked at him in surprise  but seeing they were bigger than the lion and remembering that there were two of them and only one of him the kalidahs again rushed forward and the lion crossed over the tree and turned to see what they would do next without stopping an instant the fierce beasts also began to cross the tree and the lion said to dorothy   we are lost for they will surely tear us to pieces with their sharp claws but stand close behind me and i will fight them as long as i am alive  wait a minute called the scarecrow he had been thinking what was best to be done and now he asked the woodman to chop away the end of the tree that rested on their side of the ditch the tin woodman began to use his axe at once and just as the two kalidahs were nearly across the tree fell with a crash into the gulf carrying the ugly snarling brutes with it and both were dashed to pieces on the sharp rocks at the bottom  well said the cowardly lion drawing a long breath of relief i see we are going to live a little while longer and i am glad of it for it must be a very uncomfortable thing not to be alive those creatures frightened me so badly that my heart is beating yet  ah said the tin woodman sadly i wish i had a heart to beat  this adventure made the travelers more anxious than ever to get out of the forest and they walked so fast that dorothy became tired and had to ride on the lion’s back to their great joy the trees became thinner the farther they advanced and in the afternoon they suddenly came upon a broad river flowing swiftly just before them on the other side of the water they could see the road of yellow brick running through a beautiful country with green meadows dotted with bright flowers and all the road bordered with trees hanging full of delicious fruits they were greatly pleased to see this delightful country before them  how shall we cross the river asked dorothy  that is easily done replied the scarecrow the tin woodman must build us a raft so we can float to the other side  so the woodman took his axe and began to chop down small trees to make a raft and while he was busy at this the scarecrow found on the riverbank a tree full of fine fruit this pleased dorothy who had eaten nothing but nuts all day and she made a hearty meal of the ripe fruit  but it takes time to make a raft even when one is as industrious and untiring as the tin woodman and when night came the work was not done so they found a cozy place under the trees where they slept well until the morning and dorothy dreamed of the emerald city and of the good wizard oz who would soon send her back to her own home again     chapter viii the deadly poppy field   our little party of travelers awakened the next morning refreshed and full of hope and dorothy breakfasted like a princess off peaches and plums from the trees beside the river behind them was the dark forest they had passed safely through although they had suffered many discouragements but before them was a lovely sunny country that seemed to beckon them on to the emerald city  to be sure the broad river now cut them off from this beautiful land but the raft was nearly done and after the tin woodman had cut a few more logs and fastened them together with wooden pins they were ready to start dorothy sat down in the middle of the raft and held toto in her arms when the cowardly lion stepped upon the raft it tipped badly for he was big and heavy but the scarecrow and the tin woodman stood upon the other end to steady it and they had long poles in their hands to push the raft through the water  they got along quite well at first but when they reached the middle of the river the swift current swept the raft downstream farther and farther away from the road of yellow brick and the water grew so deep that the long poles would not touch the bottom  this is bad said the tin woodman for if we cannot get to the land we shall be carried into the country of the wicked witch of the west and she will enchant us and make us her slaves  and then i should get no brains said the scarecrow  and i should get no courage said the cowardly lion  and i should get no heart said the tin woodman  and i should never get back to kansas said dorothy  we must certainly get to the emerald city if we can the scarecrow continued and he pushed so hard on his long pole that it stuck fast in the mud at the bottom of the river then before he could pull it out again—or let go—the raft was swept away and the poor scarecrow was left clinging to the pole in the middle of the river  good-bye he called after them and they were very sorry to leave him indeed the tin woodman began to cry but fortunately remembered that he might rust and so dried his tears on dorothy’s apron  of course this was a bad thing for the scarecrow  i am now worse off than when i first met dorothy he thought then i was stuck on a pole in a cornfield where i could make-believe scare the crows at any rate but surely there is no use for a scarecrow stuck on a pole in the middle of a river i am afraid i shall never have any brains after all  down the stream the raft floated and the poor scarecrow was left far behind then the lion said   something must be done to save us i think i can swim to the shore and pull the raft after me if you will only hold fast to the tip of my tail  so he sprang into the water and the tin woodman caught fast hold of his tail then the lion began to swim with all his might toward the shore it was hard work although he was so big but by and by they were drawn out of the current and then dorothy took the tin woodman’s long pole and helped push the raft to the land  they were all tired out when they reached the shore at last and stepped off upon the pretty green grass and they also knew that the stream had carried them a long way past the road of yellow brick that led to the emerald city  what shall we do now asked the tin woodman as the lion lay down on the grass to let the sun dry him  we must get back to the road in some way said dorothy  the best plan will be to walk along the riverbank until we come to the road again remarked the lion  so when they were rested dorothy picked up her basket and they started along the grassy bank to the road from which the river had carried them it was a lovely country with plenty of flowers and fruit trees and sunshine to cheer them and had they not felt so sorry for the poor scarecrow they could have been very happy  they walked along as fast as they could dorothy only stopping once to pick a beautiful flower and after a time the tin woodman cried out  look  then they all looked at the river and saw the scarecrow perched upon his pole in the middle of the water looking very lonely and sad  what can we do to save him asked dorothy  the lion and the woodman both shook their heads for they did not know so they sat down upon the bank and gazed wistfully at the scarecrow until a stork flew by who upon seeing them stopped to rest at the water’s edge  who are you and where are you going asked the stork  i am dorothy answered the girl and these are my friends the tin woodman and the cowardly lion and we are going to the emerald city  this isn’t the road said the stork as she twisted her long neck and looked sharply at the queer party  i know it returned dorothy but we have lost the scarecrow and are wondering how we shall get him again  where is he asked the stork  over there in the river answered the little girl  if he wasn’t so big and heavy i would get him for you remarked the stork  he isn’t heavy a bit said dorothy eagerly for he is stuffed with straw and if you will bring him back to us we shall thank you ever and ever so much  well i’ll try said the stork but if i find he is too heavy to carry i shall have to drop him in the river again  so the big bird flew into the air and over the water till she came to where the scarecrow was perched upon his pole then the stork with her great claws grabbed the scarecrow by the arm and carried him up into the air and back to the bank where dorothy and the lion and the tin woodman and toto were sitting  when the scarecrow found himself among his friends again he was so happy that he hugged them all even the lion and toto and as they walked along he sang tol-de-ri-de-oh at every step he felt so gay  i was afraid i should have to stay in the river forever he said but the kind stork saved me and if i ever get any brains i shall find the stork again and do her some kindness in return  that’s all right said the stork who was flying along beside them i always like to help anyone in trouble but i must go now for my babies are waiting in the nest for me i hope you will find the emerald city and that oz will help you  thank you replied dorothy and then the kind stork flew into the air and was soon out of sight  they walked along listening to the singing of the brightly colored birds and looking at the lovely flowers which now became so thick that the ground was carpeted with them there were big yellow and white and blue and purple blossoms besides great clusters of scarlet poppies which were so brilliant in color they almost dazzled dorothy’s eyes  aren’t they beautiful the girl asked as she breathed in the spicy scent of the bright flowers  i suppose so answered the scarecrow when i have brains i shall probably like them better  if i only had a heart i should love them added the tin woodman  i always did like flowers said the lion they seem so helpless and frail but there are none in the forest so bright as these  they now came upon more and more of the big scarlet poppies and fewer and fewer of the other flowers and soon they found themselves in the midst of a great meadow of poppies now it is well known that when there are many of these flowers together their odor is so powerful that anyone who breathes it falls asleep and if the sleeper is not carried away from the scent of the flowers he sleeps on and on forever but dorothy did not know this nor could she get away from the bright red flowers that were everywhere about so presently her eyes grew heavy and she felt she must sit down to rest and to sleep  but the tin woodman would not let her do this  we must hurry and get back to the road of yellow brick before dark he said and the scarecrow agreed with him so they kept walking until dorothy could stand no longer her eyes closed in spite of herself and she forgot where she was and fell among the poppies fast asleep  what shall we do asked the tin woodman  if we leave her here she will die said the lion the smell of the flowers is killing us all i myself can scarcely keep my eyes open and the dog is asleep already  it was true toto had fallen down beside his little mistress but the scarecrow and the tin woodman not being made of flesh were not troubled by the scent of the flowers  run fast said the scarecrow to the lion and get out of this deadly flower bed as soon as you can we will bring the little girl with us but if you should fall asleep you are too big to be carried  so the lion aroused himself and bounded forward as fast as he could go in a moment he was out of sight  let us make a chair with our hands and carry her said the scarecrow so they picked up toto and put the dog in dorothy’s lap and then they made a chair with their hands for the seat and their arms for the arms and carried the sleeping girl between them through the flowers  on and on they walked and it seemed that the great carpet of deadly flowers that surrounded them would never end they followed the bend of the river and at last came upon their friend the lion lying fast asleep among the poppies the flowers had been too strong for the huge beast and he had given up at last and fallen only a short distance from the end of the poppy bed where the sweet grass spread in beautiful green fields before them  we can do nothing for him said the tin woodman sadly for he is much too heavy to lift we must leave him here to sleep on forever and perhaps he will dream that he has found courage at last  i’m sorry said the scarecrow the lion was a very good comrade for one so cowardly but let us go on  they carried the sleeping girl to a pretty spot beside the river far enough from the poppy field to prevent her breathing any more of the poison of the flowers and here they laid her gently on the soft grass and waited for the fresh breeze to waken her     chapter ix the queen of the field mice   we cannot be far from the road of yellow brick now remarked the scarecrow as he stood beside the girl for we have come nearly as far as the river carried us away  the tin woodman was about to reply when he heard a low growl and turning his head which worked beautifully on hinges he saw a strange beast come bounding over the grass toward them it was indeed a great yellow wildcat and the woodman thought it must be chasing something for its ears were lying close to its head and its mouth was wide open showing two rows of ugly teeth while its red eyes glowed like balls of fire as it came nearer the tin woodman saw that running before the beast was a little gray field mouse and although he had no heart he knew it was wrong for the wildcat to try to kill such a pretty harmless creature  so the woodman raised his axe and as the wildcat ran by he gave it a quick blow that cut the beast’s head clean off from its body and it rolled over at his feet in two pieces  the field mouse now that it was freed from its enemy stopped short and coming slowly up to the woodman it said in a squeaky little voice   oh thank you thank you ever so much for saving my life  don’t speak of it i beg of you replied the woodman i have no heart you know so i am careful to help all those who may need a friend even if it happens to be only a mouse  only a mouse cried the little animal indignantly why i am a queen—the queen of all the field mice  oh indeed said the woodman making a bow  therefore you have done a great deed as well as a brave one in saving my life added the queen  at that moment several mice were seen running up as fast as their little legs could carry them and when they saw their queen they exclaimed   oh your majesty we thought you would be killed how did you manage to escape the great wildcat they all bowed so low to the little queen that they almost stood upon their heads  this funny tin man she answered killed the wildcat and saved my life so hereafter you must all serve him and obey his slightest wish  we will cried all the mice in a shrill chorus and then they scampered in all directions for toto had awakened from his sleep and seeing all these mice around him he gave one bark of delight and jumped right into the middle of the group toto had always loved to chase mice when he lived in kansas and he saw no harm in it  but the tin woodman caught the dog in his arms and held him tight while he called to the mice come back come back toto shall not hurt you  at this the queen of the mice stuck her head out from underneath a clump of grass and asked in a timid voice are you sure he will not bite us  i will not let him said the woodman so do not be afraid  one by one the mice came creeping back and toto did not bark again although he tried to get out of the woodman’s arms and would have bitten him had he not known very well he was made of tin finally one of the biggest mice spoke  is there anything we can do it asked to repay you for saving the life of our queen  nothing that i know of answered the woodman but the scarecrow who had been trying to think but could not because his head was stuffed with straw said quickly oh yes you can save our friend the cowardly lion who is asleep in the poppy bed  a lion cried the little queen why he would eat us all up  oh no declared the scarecrow this lion is a coward  really asked the mouse  he says so himself answered the scarecrow and he would never hurt anyone who is our friend if you will help us to save him i promise that he shall treat you all with kindness  very well said the queen we trust you but what shall we do  are there many of these mice which call you queen and are willing to obey you  oh yes there are thousands she replied  then send for them all to come here as soon as possible and let each one bring a long piece of string  the queen turned to the mice that attended her and told them to go at once and get all her people as soon as they heard her orders they ran away in every direction as fast as possible  now said the scarecrow to the tin woodman you must go to those trees by the riverside and make a truck that will carry the lion  so the woodman went at once to the trees and began to work and he soon made a truck out of the limbs of trees from which he chopped away all the leaves and branches he fastened it together with wooden pegs and made the four wheels out of short pieces of a big tree trunk so fast and so well did he work that by the time the mice began to arrive the truck was all ready for them  they came from all directions and there were thousands of them  big mice and little mice and middle-sized mice and each one brought a piece of string in his mouth it was about this time that dorothy woke from her long sleep and opened her eyes she was greatly astonished to find herself lying upon the grass with thousands of mice standing around and looking at her timidly but the scarecrow told her about everything and turning to the dignified little mouse he said   permit me to introduce to you her majesty the queen  dorothy nodded gravely and the queen made a curtsy after which she became quite friendly with the little girl  the scarecrow and the woodman now began to fasten the mice to the truck using the strings they had brought one end of a string was tied around the neck of each mouse and the other end to the truck of course the truck was a thousand times bigger than any of the mice who were to draw it but when all the mice had been harnessed they were able to pull it quite easily even the scarecrow and the tin woodman could sit on it and were drawn swiftly by their queer little horses to the place where the lion lay asleep  after a great deal of hard work for the lion was heavy they managed to get him up on the truck then the queen hurriedly gave her people the order to start for she feared if the mice stayed among the poppies too long they also would fall asleep  at first the little creatures many though they were could hardly stir the heavily loaded truck but the woodman and the scarecrow both pushed from behind and they got along better soon they rolled the lion out of the poppy bed to the green fields where he could breathe the sweet fresh air again instead of the poisonous scent of the flowers  dorothy came to meet them and thanked the little mice warmly for saving her companion from death she had grown so fond of the big lion she was glad he had been rescued  then the mice were unharnessed from the truck and scampered away through the grass to their homes the queen of the mice was the last to leave  if ever you need us again she said come out into the field and call and we shall hear you and come to your assistance good-bye  good-bye they all answered and away the queen ran while dorothy held toto tightly lest he should run after her and frighten her  after this they sat down beside the lion until he should awaken and the scarecrow brought dorothy some fruit from a tree near by which she ate for her dinner     chapter x the guardian of the gate   it was some time before the cowardly lion awakened for he had lain among the poppies a long while breathing in their deadly fragrance but when he did open his eyes and roll off the truck he was very glad to find himself still alive  i ran as fast as i could he said sitting down and yawning but the flowers were too strong for me how did you get me out  then they told him of the field mice and how they had generously saved him from death and the cowardly lion laughed and said   i have always thought myself very big and terrible yet such little things as flowers came near to killing me and such small animals as mice have saved my life how strange it all is but comrades what shall we do now  we must journey on until we find the road of yellow brick again said dorothy and then we can keep on to the emerald city  so the lion being fully refreshed and feeling quite himself again they all started upon the journey greatly enjoying the walk through the soft fresh grass and it was not long before they reached the road of yellow brick and turned again toward the emerald city where the great oz dwelt  the road was smooth and well paved now and the country about was beautiful so that the travelers rejoiced in leaving the forest far behind and with it the many dangers they had met in its gloomy shades once more they could see fences built beside the road but these were painted green and when they came to a small house in which a farmer evidently lived that also was painted green they passed by several of these houses during the afternoon and sometimes people came to the doors and looked at them as if they would like to ask questions but no one came near them nor spoke to them because of the great lion of which they were very much afraid the people were all dressed in clothing of a lovely emerald-green color and wore peaked hats like those of the munchkins  this must be the land of oz said dorothy and we are surely getting near the emerald city  yes answered the scarecrow everything is green here while in the country of the munchkins blue was the favorite color but the people do not seem to be as friendly as the munchkins and i’m afraid we shall be unable to find a place to pass the night  i should like something to eat besides fruit said the girl and i’m sure toto is nearly starved let us stop at the next house and talk to the people  so when they came to a good-sized farmhouse dorothy walked boldly up to the door and knocked  a woman opened it just far enough to look out and said what do you want child and why is that great lion with you  we wish to pass the night with you if you will allow us answered dorothy and the lion is my friend and comrade and would not hurt you for the world  is he tame asked the woman opening the door a little wider  oh yes said the girl and he is a great coward too he will be more afraid of you than you are of him  well said the woman after thinking it over and taking another peep at the lion if that is the case you may come in and i will give you some supper and a place to sleep  so they all entered the house where there were besides the woman two children and a man the man had hurt his leg and was lying on the couch in a corner they seemed greatly surprised to see so strange a company and while the woman was busy laying the table the man asked   where are you all going  to the emerald city said dorothy to see the great oz  oh indeed exclaimed the man are you sure that oz will see you  why not she replied  why it is said that he never lets anyone come into his presence i have been to the emerald city many times and it is a beautiful and wonderful place but i have never been permitted to see the great oz nor do i know of any living person who has seen him  does he never go out asked the scarecrow  never he sits day after day in the great throne room of his palace and even those who wait upon him do not see him face to face  what is he like asked the girl  that is hard to tell said the man thoughtfully you see oz is a great wizard and can take on any form he wishes so that some say he looks like a bird and some say he looks like an elephant and some say he looks like a cat to others he appears as a beautiful fairy or a brownie or in any other form that pleases him but who the real oz is when he is in his own form no living person can tell  that is very strange said dorothy but we must try in some way to see him or we shall have made our journey for nothing  why do you wish to see the terrible oz asked the man  i want him to give me some brains said the scarecrow eagerly  oh oz could do that easily enough declared the man he has more brains than he needs  and i want him to give me a heart said the tin woodman  that will not trouble him continued the man for oz has a large collection of hearts of all sizes and shapes  and i want him to give me courage said the cowardly lion  oz keeps a great pot of courage in his throne room said the man which he has covered with a golden plate to keep it from running over he will be glad to give you some  and i want him to send me back to kansas said dorothy  where is kansas asked the man with surprise  i don’t know replied dorothy sorrowfully but it is my home and i’m sure it’s somewhere  very likely well oz can do anything so i suppose he will find kansas for you but first you must get to see him and that will be a hard task for the great wizard does not like to see anyone and he usually has his own way but what do you want he continued speaking to toto toto only wagged his tail for strange to say he could not speak  the woman now called to them that supper was ready so they gathered around the table and dorothy ate some delicious porridge and a dish of scrambled eggs and a plate of nice white bread and enjoyed her meal the lion ate some of the porridge but did not care for it saying it was made from oats and oats were food for horses not for lions the scarecrow and the tin woodman ate nothing at all toto ate a little of everything and was glad to get a good supper again  the woman now gave dorothy a bed to sleep in and toto lay down beside her while the lion guarded the door of her room so she might not be disturbed the scarecrow and the tin woodman stood up in a corner and kept quiet all night although of course they could not sleep  the next morning as soon as the sun was up they started on their way and soon saw a beautiful green glow in the sky just before them  that must be the emerald city said dorothy  as they walked on the green glow became brighter and brighter and it seemed that at last they were nearing the end of their travels yet it was afternoon before they came to the great wall that surrounded the city it was high and thick and of a bright green color  in front of them and at the end of the road of yellow brick was a big gate all studded with emeralds that glittered so in the sun that even the painted eyes of the scarecrow were dazzled by their brilliancy  there was a bell beside the gate and dorothy pushed the button and heard a silvery tinkle sound within then the big gate swung slowly open and they all passed through and found themselves in a high arched room the walls of which glistened with countless emeralds  before them stood a little man about the same size as the munchkins he was clothed all in green from his head to his feet and even his skin was of a greenish tint at his side was a large green box  when he saw dorothy and her companions the man asked what do you wish in the emerald city  we came here to see the great oz said dorothy  the man was so surprised at this answer that he sat down to think it over  it has been many years since anyone asked me to see oz he said shaking his head in perplexity he is powerful and terrible and if you come on an idle or foolish errand to bother the wise reflections of the great wizard he might be angry and destroy you all in an instant  but it is not a foolish errand nor an idle one replied the scarecrow it is important and we have been told that oz is a good wizard  so he is said the green man and he rules the emerald city wisely and well but to those who are not honest or who approach him from curiosity he is most terrible and few have ever dared ask to see his face i am the guardian of the gates and since you demand to see the great oz i must take you to his palace but first you must put on the spectacles  why asked dorothy  because if you did not wear spectacles the brightness and glory of the emerald city would blind you even those who live in the city must wear spectacles night and day they are all locked on for oz so ordered it when the city was first built and i have the only key that will unlock them  he opened the big box and dorothy saw that it was filled with spectacles of every size and shape all of them had green glasses in them the guardian of the gates found a pair that would just fit dorothy and put them over her eyes there were two golden bands fastened to them that passed around the back of her head where they were locked together by a little key that was at the end of a chain the guardian of the gates wore around his neck when they were on dorothy could not take them off had she wished but of course she did not wish to be blinded by the glare of the emerald city so she said nothing  then the green man fitted spectacles for the scarecrow and the tin woodman and the lion and even on little toto and all were locked fast with the key  then the guardian of the gates put on his own glasses and told them he was ready to show them to the palace taking a big golden key from a peg on the wall he opened another gate and they all followed him through the portal into the streets of the emerald city     chapter xi the wonderful city of oz   even with eyes protected by the green spectacles dorothy and her friends were at first dazzled by the brilliancy of the wonderful city the streets were lined with beautiful houses all built of green marble and studded everywhere with sparkling emeralds they walked over a pavement of the same green marble and where the blocks were joined together were rows of emeralds set closely and glittering in the brightness of the sun the window panes were of green glass even the sky above the city had a green tint and the rays of the sun were green  there were many people—men women and children—walking about and these were all dressed in green clothes and had greenish skins they looked at dorothy and her strangely assorted company with wondering eyes and the children all ran away and hid behind their mothers when they saw the lion but no one spoke to them many shops stood in the street and dorothy saw that everything in them was green green candy and green pop-corn were offered for sale as well as green shoes green hats and green clothes of all sorts at one place a man was selling green lemonade and when the children bought it dorothy could see that they paid for it with green pennies  there seemed to be no horses nor animals of any kind the men carried things around in little green carts which they pushed before them everyone seemed happy and contented and prosperous  the guardian of the gates led them through the streets until they came to a big building exactly in the middle of the city which was the palace of oz the great wizard there was a soldier before the door dressed in a green uniform and wearing a long green beard  here are strangers said the guardian of the gates to him and they demand to see the great oz  step inside answered the soldier and i will carry your message to him  so they passed through the palace gates and were led into a big room with a green carpet and lovely green furniture set with emeralds the soldier made them all wipe their feet upon a green mat before entering this room and when they were seated he said politely   please make yourselves comfortable while i go to the door of the throne room and tell oz you are here  they had to wait a long time before the soldier returned when at last he came back dorothy asked   have you seen oz  oh no returned the soldier i have never seen him but i spoke to him as he sat behind his screen and gave him your message he said he will grant you an audience if you so desire but each one of you must enter his presence alone and he will admit but one each day therefore as you must remain in the palace for several days i will have you shown to rooms where you may rest in comfort after your journey  thank you replied the girl that is very kind of oz  the soldier now blew upon a green whistle and at once a young girl dressed in a pretty green silk gown entered the room she had lovely green hair and green eyes and she bowed low before dorothy as she said follow me and i will show you your room  so dorothy said good-bye to all her friends except toto and taking the dog in her arms followed the green girl through seven passages and up three flights of stairs until they came to a room at the front of the palace it was the sweetest little room in the world with a soft comfortable bed that had sheets of green silk and a green velvet counterpane there was a tiny fountain in the middle of the room that shot a spray of green perfume into the air to fall back into a beautifully carved green marble basin beautiful green flowers stood in the windows and there was a shelf with a row of little green books when dorothy had time to open these books she found them full of queer green pictures that made her laugh they were so funny  in a wardrobe were many green dresses made of silk and satin and velvet and all of them fitted dorothy exactly  make yourself perfectly at home said the green girl and if you wish for anything ring the bell oz will send for you tomorrow morning  she left dorothy alone and went back to the others these she also led to rooms and each one of them found himself lodged in a very pleasant part of the palace of course this politeness was wasted on the scarecrow for when he found himself alone in his room he stood stupidly in one spot just within the doorway to wait till morning it would not rest him to lie down and he could not close his eyes so he remained all night staring at a little spider which was weaving its web in a corner of the room just as if it were not one of the most wonderful rooms in the world the tin woodman lay down on his bed from force of habit for he remembered when he was made of flesh but not being able to sleep he passed the night moving his joints up and down to make sure they kept in good working order the lion would have preferred a bed of dried leaves in the forest and did not like being shut up in a room but he had too much sense to let this worry him so he sprang upon the bed and rolled himself up like a cat and purred himself asleep in a minute  the next morning after breakfast the green maiden came to fetch dorothy and she dressed her in one of the prettiest gowns made of green brocaded satin dorothy put on a green silk apron and tied a green ribbon around toto’s neck and they started for the throne room of the great oz  first they came to a great hall in which were many ladies and gentlemen of the court all dressed in rich costumes these people had nothing to do but talk to each other but they always came to wait outside the throne room every morning although they were never permitted to see oz as dorothy entered they looked at her curiously and one of them whispered   are you really going to look upon the face of oz the terrible  of course answered the girl if he will see me  oh he will see you said the soldier who had taken her message to the wizard although he does not like to have people ask to see him indeed at first he was angry and said i should send you back where you came from then he asked me what you looked like and when i mentioned your silver shoes he was very much interested at last i told him about the mark upon your forehead and he decided he would admit you to his presence  just then a bell rang and the green girl said to dorothy that is the signal you must go into the throne room alone  she opened a little door and dorothy walked boldly through and found herself in a wonderful place it was a big round room with a high arched roof and the walls and ceiling and floor were covered with large emeralds set closely together in the center of the roof was a great light as bright as the sun which made the emeralds sparkle in a wonderful manner  but what interested dorothy most was the big throne of green marble that stood in the middle of the room it was shaped like a chair and sparkled with gems as did everything else in the center of the chair was an enormous head without a body to support it or any arms or legs whatever there was no hair upon this head but it had eyes and a nose and mouth and was much bigger than the head of the biggest giant  as dorothy gazed upon this in wonder and fear the eyes turned slowly and looked at her sharply and steadily then the mouth moved and dorothy heard a voice say   i am oz the great and terrible who are you and why do you seek me  it was not such an awful voice as she had expected to come from the big head so she took courage and answered   i am dorothy the small and meek i have come to you for help  the eyes looked at her thoughtfully for a full minute then said the voice   where did you get the silver shoes  i got them from the wicked witch of the east when my house fell on her and killed her she replied  where did you get the mark upon your forehead continued the voice  that is where the good witch of the north kissed me when she bade me good-bye and sent me to you said the girl  again the eyes looked at her sharply and they saw she was telling the truth then oz asked what do you wish me to do  send me back to kansas where my aunt em and uncle henry are she answered earnestly i don’t like your country although it is so beautiful and i am sure aunt em will be dreadfully worried over my being away so long  the eyes winked three times and then they turned up to the ceiling and down to the floor and rolled around so queerly that they seemed to see every part of the room and at last they looked at dorothy again  why should i do this for you asked oz  because you are strong and i am weak because you are a great wizard and i am only a little girl  but you were strong enough to kill the wicked witch of the east said oz  that just happened returned dorothy simply i could not help it  well said the head i will give you my answer you have no right to expect me to send you back to kansas unless you do something for me in return in this country everyone must pay for everything he gets if you wish me to use my magic power to send you home again you must do something for me first help me and i will help you  what must i do asked the girl  kill the wicked witch of the west answered oz  but i cannot exclaimed dorothy greatly surprised  you killed the witch of the east and you wear the silver shoes which bear a powerful charm there is now but one wicked witch left in all this land and when you can tell me she is dead i will send you back to kansas—but not before  the little girl began to weep she was so much disappointed and the eyes winked again and looked upon her anxiously as if the great oz felt that she could help him if she would  i never killed anything willingly she sobbed even if i wanted to how could i kill the wicked witch if you who are great and terrible cannot kill her yourself how do you expect me to do it  i do not know said the head but that is my answer and until the wicked witch dies you will not see your uncle and aunt again remember that the witch is wicked—tremendously wicked—and ought to be killed now go and do not ask to see me again until you have done your task  sorrowfully dorothy left the throne room and went back where the lion and the scarecrow and the tin woodman were waiting to hear what oz had said to her there is no hope for me she said sadly for oz will not send me home until i have killed the wicked witch of the west and that i can never do  her friends were sorry but could do nothing to help her so dorothy went to her own room and lay down on the bed and cried herself to sleep  the next morning the soldier with the green whiskers came to the scarecrow and said   come with me for oz has sent for you  so the scarecrow followed him and was admitted into the great throne room where he saw sitting in the emerald throne a most lovely lady she was dressed in green silk gauze and wore upon her flowing green locks a crown of jewels growing from her shoulders were wings gorgeous in color and so light that they fluttered if the slightest breath of air reached them  when the scarecrow had bowed as prettily as his straw stuffing would let him before this beautiful creature she looked upon him sweetly and said   i am oz the great and terrible who are you and why do you seek me  now the scarecrow who had expected to see the great head dorothy had told him of was much astonished but he answered her bravely  i am only a scarecrow stuffed with straw therefore i have no brains and i come to you praying that you will put brains in my head instead of straw so that i may become as much a man as any other in your dominions  why should i do this for you asked the lady  because you are wise and powerful and no one else can help me answered the scarecrow  i never grant favors without some return said oz but this much i will promise if you will kill for me the wicked witch of the west i will bestow upon you a great many brains and such good brains that you will be the wisest man in all the land of oz  i thought you asked dorothy to kill the witch said the scarecrow in surprise  so i did i don’t care who kills her but until she is dead i will not grant your wish now go and do not seek me again until you have earned the brains you so greatly desire  the scarecrow went sorrowfully back to his friends and told them what oz had said and dorothy was surprised to find that the great wizard was not a head as she had seen him but a lovely lady  all the same said the scarecrow she needs a heart as much as the tin woodman  on the next morning the soldier with the green whiskers came to the tin woodman and said   oz has sent for you follow me  so the tin woodman followed him and came to the great throne room he did not know whether he would find oz a lovely lady or a head but he hoped it would be the lovely lady for he said to himself if it is the head i am sure i shall not be given a heart since a head has no heart of its own and therefore cannot feel for me but if it is the lovely lady i shall beg hard for a heart for all ladies are themselves said to be kindly hearted  but when the woodman entered the great throne room he saw neither the head nor the lady for oz had taken the shape of a most terrible beast it was nearly as big as an elephant and the green throne seemed hardly strong enough to hold its weight the beast had a head like that of a rhinoceros only there were five eyes in its face there were five long arms growing out of its body and it also had five long slim legs thick woolly hair covered every part of it and a more dreadful-looking monster could not be imagined it was fortunate the tin woodman had no heart at that moment for it would have beat loud and fast from terror but being only tin the woodman was not at all afraid although he was much disappointed  i am oz the great and terrible spoke the beast in a voice that was one great roar who are you and why do you seek me  i am a woodman and made of tin therefore i have no heart and cannot love i pray you to give me a heart that i may be as other men are  why should i do this demanded the beast  because i ask it and you alone can grant my request answered the woodman  oz gave a low growl at this but said gruffly  if you indeed desire a heart you must earn it  how asked the woodman  help dorothy to kill the wicked witch of the west replied the beast when the witch is dead come to me and i will then give you the biggest and kindest and most loving heart in all the land of oz  so the tin woodman was forced to return sorrowfully to his friends and tell them of the terrible beast he had seen they all wondered greatly at the many forms the great wizard could take upon himself and the lion said   if he is a beast when i go to see him i shall roar my loudest and so frighten him that he will grant all i ask and if he is the lovely lady i shall pretend to spring upon her and so compel her to do my bidding and if he is the great head he will be at my mercy for i will roll this head all about the room until he promises to give us what we desire so be of good cheer my friends for all will yet be well  the next morning the soldier with the green whiskers led the lion to the great throne room and bade him enter the presence of oz  the lion at once passed through the door and glancing around saw to his surprise that before the throne was a ball of fire so fierce and glowing he could scarcely bear to gaze upon it his first thought was that oz had by accident caught on fire and was burning up but when he tried to go nearer the heat was so intense that it singed his whiskers and he crept back tremblingly to a spot nearer the door  then a low quiet voice came from the ball of fire and these were the words it spoke   i am oz the great and terrible who are you and why do you seek me  and the lion answered i am a cowardly lion afraid of everything i came to you to beg that you give me courage so that in reality i may become the king of beasts as men call me  why should i give you courage demanded oz  because of all wizards you are the greatest and alone have power to grant my request answered the lion  the ball of fire burned fiercely for a time and the voice said bring me proof that the wicked witch is dead and that moment i will give you courage but as long as the witch lives you must remain a coward  the lion was angry at this speech but could say nothing in reply and while he stood silently gazing at the ball of fire it became so furiously hot that he turned tail and rushed from the room he was glad to find his friends waiting for him and told them of his terrible interview with the wizard  what shall we do now asked dorothy sadly  there is only one thing we can do returned the lion and that is to go to the land of the winkies seek out the wicked witch and destroy her  but suppose we cannot said the girl  then i shall never have courage declared the lion  and i shall never have brains added the scarecrow  and i shall never have a heart spoke the tin woodman  and i shall never see aunt em and uncle henry said dorothy beginning to cry  be careful cried the green girl the tears will fall on your green silk gown and spot it  so dorothy dried her eyes and said i suppose we must try it but i am sure i do not want to kill anybody even to see aunt em again  i will go with you but i’m too much of a coward to kill the witch said the lion  i will go too declared the scarecrow but i shall not be of much help to you i am such a fool  i haven’t the heart to harm even a witch remarked the tin woodman but if you go i certainly shall go with you  therefore it was decided to start upon their journey the next morning and the woodman sharpened his axe on a green grindstone and had all his joints properly oiled the scarecrow stuffed himself with fresh straw and dorothy put new paint on his eyes that he might see better the green girl who was very kind to them filled dorothy’s basket with good things to eat and fastened a little bell around toto’s neck with a green ribbon  they went to bed quite early and slept soundly until daylight when they were awakened by the crowing of a green cock that lived in the back yard of the palace and the cackling of a hen that had laid a green egg     chapter xii the search for the wicked witch   the soldier with the green whiskers led them through the streets of the emerald city until they reached the room where the guardian of the gates lived this officer unlocked their spectacles to put them back in his great box and then he politely opened the gate for our friends  which road leads to the wicked witch of the west asked dorothy  there is no road answered the guardian of the gates no one ever wishes to go that way  how then are we to find her inquired the girl  that will be easy replied the man for when she knows you are in the country of the winkies she will find you and make you all her slaves  perhaps not said the scarecrow for we mean to destroy her  oh that is different said the guardian of the gates no one has ever destroyed her before so i naturally thought she would make slaves of you as she has of the rest but take care for she is wicked and fierce and may not allow you to destroy her keep to the west where the sun sets and you cannot fail to find her  they thanked him and bade him good-bye and turned toward the west walking over fields of soft grass dotted here and there with daisies and buttercups dorothy still wore the pretty silk dress she had put on in the palace but now to her surprise she found it was no longer green but pure white the ribbon around toto’s neck had also lost its green color and was as white as dorothy’s dress  the emerald city was soon left far behind as they advanced the ground became rougher and hillier for there were no farms nor houses in this country of the west and the ground was untilled  in the afternoon the sun shone hot in their faces for there were no trees to offer them shade so that before night dorothy and toto and the lion were tired and lay down upon the grass and fell asleep with the woodman and the scarecrow keeping watch  now the wicked witch of the west had but one eye yet that was as powerful as a telescope and could see everywhere so as she sat in the door of her castle she happened to look around and saw dorothy lying asleep with her friends all about her they were a long distance off but the wicked witch was angry to find them in her country so she blew upon a silver whistle that hung around her neck  at once there came running to her from all directions a pack of great wolves they had long legs and fierce eyes and sharp teeth  go to those people said the witch and tear them to pieces  are you not going to make them your slaves asked the leader of the wolves  no she answered one is of tin and one of straw one is a girl and another a lion none of them is fit to work so you may tear them into small pieces  very well said the wolf and he dashed away at full speed followed by the others  it was lucky the scarecrow and the woodman were wide awake and heard the wolves coming  this is my fight said the woodman so get behind me and i will meet them as they come  he seized his axe which he had made very sharp and as the leader of the wolves came on the tin woodman swung his arm and chopped the wolf’s head from its body so that it immediately died as soon as he could raise his axe another wolf came up and he also fell under the sharp edge of the tin woodman’s weapon there were forty wolves and forty times a wolf was killed so that at last they all lay dead in a heap before the woodman  then he put down his axe and sat beside the scarecrow who said it was a good fight friend  they waited until dorothy awoke the next morning the little girl was quite frightened when she saw the great pile of shaggy wolves but the tin woodman told her all she thanked him for saving them and sat down to breakfast after which they started again upon their journey  now this same morning the wicked witch came to the door of her castle and looked out with her one eye that could see far off she saw all her wolves lying dead and the strangers still traveling through her country this made her angrier than before and she blew her silver whistle twice  straightway a great flock of wild crows came flying toward her enough to darken the sky  and the wicked witch said to the king crow fly at once to the strangers peck out their eyes and tear them to pieces  the wild crows flew in one great flock toward dorothy and her companions when the little girl saw them coming she was afraid  but the scarecrow said this is my battle so lie down beside me and you will not be harmed  so they all lay upon the ground except the scarecrow and he stood up and stretched out his arms and when the crows saw him they were frightened as these birds always are by scarecrows and did not dare to come any nearer but the king crow said   it is only a stuffed man i will peck his eyes out  the king crow flew at the scarecrow who caught it by the head and twisted its neck until it died and then another crow flew at him and the scarecrow twisted its neck also there were forty crows and forty times the scarecrow twisted a neck until at last all were lying dead beside him then he called to his companions to rise and again they went upon their journey  when the wicked witch looked out again and saw all her crows lying in a heap she got into a terrible rage and blew three times upon her silver whistle  forthwith there was heard a great buzzing in the air and a swarm of black bees came flying toward her  go to the strangers and sting them to death commanded the witch and the bees turned and flew rapidly until they came to where dorothy and her friends were walking but the woodman had seen them coming and the scarecrow had decided what to do  take out my straw and scatter it over the little girl and the dog and the lion he said to the woodman and the bees cannot sting them this the woodman did and as dorothy lay close beside the lion and held toto in her arms the straw covered them entirely  the bees came and found no one but the woodman to sting so they flew at him and broke off all their stings against the tin without hurting the woodman at all and as bees cannot live when their stings are broken that was the end of the black bees and they lay scattered thick about the woodman like little heaps of fine coal  then dorothy and the lion got up and the girl helped the tin woodman put the straw back into the scarecrow again until he was as good as ever so they started upon their journey once more  the wicked witch was so angry when she saw her black bees in little heaps like fine coal that she stamped her foot and tore her hair and gnashed her teeth and then she called a dozen of her slaves who were the winkies and gave them sharp spears telling them to go to the strangers and destroy them  the winkies were not a brave people but they had to do as they were told so they marched away until they came near to dorothy then the lion gave a great roar and sprang towards them and the poor winkies were so frightened that they ran back as fast as they could  when they returned to the castle the wicked witch beat them well with a strap and sent them back to their work after which she sat down to think what she should do next she could not understand how all her plans to destroy these strangers had failed but she was a powerful witch as well as a wicked one and she soon made up her mind how to act  there was in her cupboard a golden cap with a circle of diamonds and rubies running round it this golden cap had a charm whoever owned it could call three times upon the winged monkeys who would obey any order they were given but no person could command these strange creatures more than three times twice already the wicked witch had used the charm of the cap once was when she had made the winkies her slaves and set herself to rule over their country the winged monkeys had helped her do this the second time was when she had fought against the great oz himself and driven him out of the land of the west the winged monkeys had also helped her in doing this only once more could she use this golden cap for which reason she did not like to do so until all her other powers were exhausted but now that her fierce wolves and her wild crows and her stinging bees were gone and her slaves had been scared away by the cowardly lion she saw there was only one way left to destroy dorothy and her friends  so the wicked witch took the golden cap from her cupboard and placed it upon her head then she stood upon her left foot and said slowly   ep-pe pep-pe kak-ke  next she stood upon her right foot and said   hil-lo hol-lo hel-lo  after this she stood upon both feet and cried in a loud voice   ziz-zy zuz-zy zik  now the charm began to work the sky was darkened and a low rumbling sound was heard in the air there was a rushing of many wings a great chattering and laughing and the sun came out of the dark sky to show the wicked witch surrounded by a crowd of monkeys each with a pair of immense and powerful wings on his shoulders  one much bigger than the others seemed to be their leader he flew close to the witch and said you have called us for the third and last time what do you command  go to the strangers who are within my land and destroy them all except the lion said the wicked witch bring that beast to me for i have a mind to harness him like a horse and make him work  your commands shall be obeyed said the leader then with a great deal of chattering and noise the winged monkeys flew away to the place where dorothy and her friends were walking  some of the monkeys seized the tin woodman and carried him through the air until they were over a country thickly covered with sharp rocks here they dropped the poor woodman who fell a great distance to the rocks where he lay so battered and dented that he could neither move nor groan  others of the monkeys caught the scarecrow and with their long fingers pulled all of the straw out of his clothes and head they made his hat and boots and clothes into a small bundle and threw it into the top branches of a tall tree  the remaining monkeys threw pieces of stout rope around the lion and wound many coils about his body and head and legs until he was unable to bite or scratch or struggle in any way then they lifted him up and flew away with him to the witch’s castle where he was placed in a small yard with a high iron fence around it so that he could not escape  but dorothy they did not harm at all she stood with toto in her arms watching the sad fate of her comrades and thinking it would soon be her turn the leader of the winged monkeys flew up to her his long hairy arms stretched out and his ugly face grinning terribly but he saw the mark of the good witch’s kiss upon her forehead and stopped short motioning the others not to touch her  we dare not harm this little girl he said to them for she is protected by the power of good and that is greater than the power of evil all we can do is to carry her to the castle of the wicked witch and leave her there  so carefully and gently they lifted dorothy in their arms and carried her swiftly through the air until they came to the castle where they set her down upon the front doorstep then the leader said to the witch   we have obeyed you as far as we were able the tin woodman and the scarecrow are destroyed and the lion is tied up in your yard the little girl we dare not harm nor the dog she carries in her arms your power over our band is now ended and you will never see us again  then all the winged monkeys with much laughing and chattering and noise flew into the air and were soon out of sight  the wicked witch was both surprised and worried when she saw the mark on dorothy’s forehead for she knew well that neither the winged monkeys nor she herself dare hurt the girl in any way she looked down at dorothy’s feet and seeing the silver shoes began to tremble with fear for she knew what a powerful charm belonged to them at first the witch was tempted to run away from dorothy but she happened to look into the child’s eyes and saw how simple the soul behind them was and that the little girl did not know of the wonderful power the silver shoes gave her so the wicked witch laughed to herself and thought i can still make her my slave for she does not know how to use her power then she said to dorothy harshly and severely   come with me and see that you mind everything i tell you for if you do not i will make an end of you as i did of the tin woodman and the scarecrow  dorothy followed her through many of the beautiful rooms in her castle until they came to the kitchen where the witch bade her clean the pots and kettles and sweep the floor and keep the fire fed with wood  dorothy went to work meekly with her mind made up to work as hard as she could for she was glad the wicked witch had decided not to kill her  with dorothy hard at work the witch thought she would go into the courtyard and harness the cowardly lion like a horse it would amuse her she was sure to make him draw her chariot whenever she wished to go to drive but as she opened the gate the lion gave a loud roar and bounded at her so fiercely that the witch was afraid and ran out and shut the gate again  if i cannot harness you said the witch to the lion speaking through the bars of the gate i can starve you you shall have nothing to eat until you do as i wish  so after that she took no food to the imprisoned lion but every day she came to the gate at noon and asked are you ready to be harnessed like a horse  and the lion would answer no if you come in this yard i will bite you  the reason the lion did not have to do as the witch wished was that every night while the woman was asleep dorothy carried him food from the cupboard after he had eaten he would lie down on his bed of straw and dorothy would lie beside him and put her head on his soft shaggy mane while they talked of their troubles and tried to plan some way to escape but they could find no way to get out of the castle for it was constantly guarded by the yellow winkies who were the slaves of the wicked witch and too afraid of her not to do as she told them  the girl had to work hard during the day and often the witch threatened to beat her with the same old umbrella she always carried in her hand but in truth she did not dare to strike dorothy because of the mark upon her forehead the child did not know this and was full of fear for herself and toto once the witch struck toto a blow with her umbrella and the brave little dog flew at her and bit her leg in return the witch did not bleed where she was bitten for she was so wicked that the blood in her had dried up many years before  dorothy’s life became very sad as she grew to understand that it would be harder than ever to get back to kansas and aunt em again sometimes she would cry bitterly for hours with toto sitting at her feet and looking into her face whining dismally to show how sorry he was for his little mistress toto did not really care whether he was in kansas or the land of oz so long as dorothy was with him but he knew the little girl was unhappy and that made him unhappy too  now the wicked witch had a great longing to have for her own the silver shoes which the girl always wore her bees and her crows and her wolves were lying in heaps and drying up and she had used up all the power of the golden cap but if she could only get hold of the silver shoes they would give her more power than all the other things she had lost she watched dorothy carefully to see if she ever took off her shoes thinking she might steal them but the child was so proud of her pretty shoes that she never took them off except at night and when she took her bath the witch was too much afraid of the dark to dare go in dorothy’s room at night to take the shoes and her dread of water was greater than her fear of the dark so she never came near when dorothy was bathing indeed the old witch never touched water nor ever let water touch her in any way  but the wicked creature was very cunning and she finally thought of a trick that would give her what she wanted she placed a bar of iron in the middle of the kitchen floor and then by her magic arts made the iron invisible to human eyes so that when dorothy walked across the floor she stumbled over the bar not being able to see it and fell at full length she was not much hurt but in her fall one of the silver shoes came off and before she could reach it the witch had snatched it away and put it on her own skinny foot  the wicked woman was greatly pleased with the success of her trick for as long as she had one of the shoes she owned half the power of their charm and dorothy could not use it against her even had she known how to do so  the little girl seeing she had lost one of her pretty shoes grew angry and said to the witch give me back my shoe  i will not retorted the witch for it is now my shoe and not yours  you are a wicked creature cried dorothy you have no right to take my shoe from me  i shall keep it just the same said the witch laughing at her and someday i shall get the other one from you too  this made dorothy so very angry that she picked up the bucket of water that stood near and dashed it over the witch wetting her from head to foot  instantly the wicked woman gave a loud cry of fear and then as dorothy looked at her in wonder the witch began to shrink and fall away  see what you have done she screamed in a minute i shall melt away  i’m very sorry indeed said dorothy who was truly frightened to see the witch actually melting away like brown sugar before her very eyes  didn’t you know water would be the end of me asked the witch in a wailing despairing voice  of course not answered dorothy how should i  well in a few minutes i shall be all melted and you will have the castle to yourself i have been wicked in my day but i never thought a little girl like you would ever be able to melt me and end my wicked deeds look out—here i go  with these words the witch fell down in a brown melted shapeless mass and began to spread over the clean boards of the kitchen floor seeing that she had really melted away to nothing dorothy drew another bucket of water and threw it over the mess she then swept it all out the door after picking out the silver shoe which was all that was left of the old woman she cleaned and dried it with a cloth and put it on her foot again then being at last free to do as she chose she ran out to the courtyard to tell the lion that the wicked witch of the west had come to an end and that they were no longer prisoners in a strange land     chapter xiii the rescue   the cowardly lion was much pleased to hear that the wicked witch had been melted by a bucket of water and dorothy at once unlocked the gate of his prison and set him free they went in together to the castle where dorothy’s first act was to call all the winkies together and tell them that they were no longer slaves  there was great rejoicing among the yellow winkies for they had been made to work hard during many years for the wicked witch who had always treated them with great cruelty they kept this day as a holiday then and ever after and spent the time in feasting and dancing  if our friends the scarecrow and the tin woodman were only with us said the lion i should be quite happy  don’t you suppose we could rescue them asked the girl anxiously  we can try answered the lion  so they called the yellow winkies and asked them if they would help to rescue their friends and the winkies said that they would be delighted to do all in their power for dorothy who had set them free from bondage so she chose a number of the winkies who looked as if they knew the most and they all started away they traveled that day and part of the next until they came to the rocky plain where the tin woodman lay all battered and bent his axe was near him but the blade was rusted and the handle broken off short  the winkies lifted him tenderly in their arms and carried him back to the yellow castle again dorothy shedding a few tears by the way at the sad plight of her old friend and the lion looking sober and sorry when they reached the castle dorothy said to the winkies   are any of your people tinsmiths  oh yes some of us are very good tinsmiths they told her  then bring them to me she said and when the tinsmiths came bringing with them all their tools in baskets she inquired can you straighten out those dents in the tin woodman and bend him back into shape again and solder him together where he is broken  the tinsmiths looked the woodman over carefully and then answered that they thought they could mend him so he would be as good as ever so they set to work in one of the big yellow rooms of the castle and worked for three days and four nights hammering and twisting and bending and soldering and polishing and pounding at the legs and body and head of the tin woodman until at last he was straightened out into his old form and his joints worked as well as ever to be sure there were several patches on him but the tinsmiths did a good job and as the woodman was not a vain man he did not mind the patches at all  when at last he walked into dorothy’s room and thanked her for rescuing him he was so pleased that he wept tears of joy and dorothy had to wipe every tear carefully from his face with her apron so his joints would not be rusted at the same time her own tears fell thick and fast at the joy of meeting her old friend again and these tears did not need to be wiped away as for the lion he wiped his eyes so often with the tip of his tail that it became quite wet and he was obliged to go out into the courtyard and hold it in the sun till it dried  if we only had the scarecrow with us again said the tin woodman when dorothy had finished telling him everything that had happened i should be quite happy  we must try to find him said the girl  so she called the winkies to help her and they walked all that day and part of the next until they came to the tall tree in the branches of which the winged monkeys had tossed the scarecrow’s clothes  it was a very tall tree and the trunk was so smooth that no one could climb it but the woodman said at once i’ll chop it down and then we can get the scarecrow’s clothes  now while the tinsmiths had been at work mending the woodman himself another of the winkies who was a goldsmith had made an axe-handle of solid gold and fitted it to the woodman’s axe instead of the old broken handle others polished the blade until all the rust was removed and it glistened like burnished silver  as soon as he had spoken the tin woodman began to chop and in a short time the tree fell over with a crash whereupon the scarecrow’s clothes fell out of the branches and rolled off on the ground  dorothy picked them up and had the winkies carry them back to the castle where they were stuffed with nice clean straw and behold here was the scarecrow as good as ever thanking them over and over again for saving him  now that they were reunited dorothy and her friends spent a few happy days at the yellow castle where they found everything they needed to make them comfortable  but one day the girl thought of aunt em and said we must go back to oz and claim his promise  yes said the woodman at last i shall get my heart  and i shall get my brains added the scarecrow joyfully  and i shall get my courage said the lion thoughtfully  and i shall get back to kansas cried dorothy clapping her hands oh let us start for the emerald city tomorrow  this they decided to do the next day they called the winkies together and bade them good-bye the winkies were sorry to have them go and they had grown so fond of the tin woodman that they begged him to stay and rule over them and the yellow land of the west finding they were determined to go the winkies gave toto and the lion each a golden collar and to dorothy they presented a beautiful bracelet studded with diamonds and to the scarecrow they gave a gold-headed walking stick to keep him from stumbling and to the tin woodman they offered a silver oil-can inlaid with gold and set with precious jewels  every one of the travelers made the winkies a pretty speech in return and all shook hands with them until their arms ached  dorothy went to the witch’s cupboard to fill her basket with food for the journey and there she saw the golden cap she tried it on her own head and found that it fitted her exactly she did not know anything about the charm of the golden cap but she saw that it was pretty so she made up her mind to wear it and carry her sunbonnet in the basket  then being prepared for the journey they all started for the emerald city and the winkies gave them three cheers and many good wishes to carry with them     chapter xiv the winged monkeys   you will remember there was no road—not even a pathway—between the castle of the wicked witch and the emerald city when the four travelers went in search of the witch she had seen them coming and so sent the winged monkeys to bring them to her it was much harder to find their way back through the big fields of buttercups and yellow daisies than it was being carried they knew of course they must go straight east toward the rising sun and they started off in the right way but at noon when the sun was over their heads they did not know which was east and which was west and that was the reason they were lost in the great fields they kept on walking however and at night the moon came out and shone brightly so they lay down among the sweet smelling yellow flowers and slept soundly until morning—all but the scarecrow and the tin woodman  the next morning the sun was behind a cloud but they started on as if they were quite sure which way they were going  if we walk far enough said dorothy i am sure we shall sometime come to some place  but day by day passed away and they still saw nothing before them but the scarlet fields the scarecrow began to grumble a bit  we have surely lost our way he said and unless we find it again in time to reach the emerald city i shall never get my brains  nor i my heart declared the tin woodman it seems to me i can scarcely wait till i get to oz and you must admit this is a very long journey  you see said the cowardly lion with a whimper i haven’t the courage to keep tramping forever without getting anywhere at all  then dorothy lost heart she sat down on the grass and looked at her companions and they sat down and looked at her and toto found that for the first time in his life he was too tired to chase a butterfly that flew past his head so he put out his tongue and panted and looked at dorothy as if to ask what they should do next  suppose we call the field mice she suggested they could probably tell us the way to the emerald city  to be sure they could cried the scarecrow why didn’t we think of that before  dorothy blew the little whistle she had always carried about her neck since the queen of the mice had given it to her in a few minutes they heard the pattering of tiny feet and many of the small gray mice came running up to her among them was the queen herself who asked in her squeaky little voice   what can i do for my friends  we have lost our way said dorothy can you tell us where the emerald city is  certainly answered the queen but it is a great way off for you have had it at your backs all this time then she noticed dorothy’s golden cap and said why don’t you use the charm of the cap and call the winged monkeys to you they will carry you to the city of oz in less than an hour  i didn’t know there was a charm answered dorothy in surprise what is it  it is written inside the golden cap replied the queen of the mice but if you are going to call the winged monkeys we must run away for they are full of mischief and think it great fun to plague us  won’t they hurt me asked the girl anxiously  oh no they must obey the wearer of the cap good-bye and she scampered out of sight with all the mice hurrying after her  dorothy looked inside the golden cap and saw some words written upon the lining these she thought must be the charm so she read the directions carefully and put the cap upon her head  ep-pe pep-pe kak-ke she said standing on her left foot  what did you say asked the scarecrow who did not know what she was doing  hil-lo hol-lo hel-lo dorothy went on standing this time on her right foot  hello replied the tin woodman calmly  ziz-zy zuz-zy zik said dorothy who was now standing on both feet this ended the saying of the charm and they heard a great chattering and flapping of wings as the band of winged monkeys flew up to them  the king bowed low before dorothy and asked what is your command  we wish to go to the emerald city said the child and we have lost our way  we will carry you replied the king and no sooner had he spoken than two of the monkeys caught dorothy in their arms and flew away with her others took the scarecrow and the woodman and the lion and one little monkey seized toto and flew after them although the dog tried hard to bite him  the scarecrow and the tin woodman were rather frightened at first for they remembered how badly the winged monkeys had treated them before but they saw that no harm was intended so they rode through the air quite cheerfully and had a fine time looking at the pretty gardens and woods far below them  dorothy found herself riding easily between two of the biggest monkeys one of them the king himself they had made a chair of their hands and were careful not to hurt her  why do you have to obey the charm of the golden cap she asked  that is a long story answered the king with a winged laugh but as we have a long journey before us i will pass the time by telling you about it if you wish  i shall be glad to hear it she replied  once began the leader we were a free people living happily in the great forest flying from tree to tree eating nuts and fruit and doing just as we pleased without calling anybody master perhaps some of us were rather too full of mischief at times flying down to pull the tails of the animals that had no wings chasing birds and throwing nuts at the people who walked in the forest but we were careless and happy and full of fun and enjoyed every minute of the day this was many years ago long before oz came out of the clouds to rule over this land  there lived here then away at the north a beautiful princess who was also a powerful sorceress all her magic was used to help the people and she was never known to hurt anyone who was good her name was gayelette and she lived in a handsome palace built from great blocks of ruby everyone loved her but her greatest sorrow was that she could find no one to love in return since all the men were much too stupid and ugly to mate with one so beautiful and wise at last however she found a boy who was handsome and manly and wise beyond his years gayelette made up her mind that when he grew to be a man she would make him her husband so she took him to her ruby palace and used all her magic powers to make him as strong and good and lovely as any woman could wish when he grew to manhood quelala as he was called was said to be the best and wisest man in all the land while his manly beauty was so great that gayelette loved him dearly and hastened to make everything ready for the wedding  my grandfather was at that time the king of the winged monkeys which lived in the forest near gayelette’s palace and the old fellow loved a joke better than a good dinner one day just before the wedding my grandfather was flying out with his band when he saw quelala walking beside the river he was dressed in a rich costume of pink silk and purple velvet and my grandfather thought he would see what he could do at his word the band flew down and seized quelala carried him in their arms until they were over the middle of the river and then dropped him into the water  ‘swim out my fine fellow’ cried my grandfather ‘and see if the water has spotted your clothes’ quelala was much too wise not to swim and he was not in the least spoiled by all his good fortune he laughed when he came to the top of the water and swam in to shore but when gayelette came running out to him she found his silks and velvet all ruined by the river  the princess was angry and she knew of course who did it she had all the winged monkeys brought before her and she said at first that their wings should be tied and they should be treated as they had treated quelala and dropped in the river but my grandfather pleaded hard for he knew the monkeys would drown in the river with their wings tied and quelala said a kind word for them also so that gayelette finally spared them on condition that the winged monkeys should ever after do three times the bidding of the owner of the golden cap this cap had been made for a wedding present to quelala and it is said to have cost the princess half her kingdom of course my grandfather and all the other monkeys at once agreed to the condition and that is how it happens that we are three times the slaves of the owner of the golden cap whosoever he may be  and what became of them asked dorothy who had been greatly interested in the story  quelala being the first owner of the golden cap replied the monkey he was the first to lay his wishes upon us as his bride could not bear the sight of us he called us all to him in the forest after he had married her and ordered us always to keep where she could never again set eyes on a winged monkey which we were glad to do for we were all afraid of her  this was all we ever had to do until the golden cap fell into the hands of the wicked witch of the west who made us enslave the winkies and afterward drive oz himself out of the land of the west now the golden cap is yours and three times you have the right to lay your wishes upon us  as the monkey king finished his story dorothy looked down and saw the green shining walls of the emerald city before them she wondered at the rapid flight of the monkeys but was glad the journey was over the strange creatures set the travelers down carefully before the gate of the city the king bowed low to dorothy and then flew swiftly away followed by all his band  that was a good ride said the little girl  yes and a quick way out of our troubles replied the lion how lucky it was you brought away that wonderful cap     chapter xv the discovery of oz the terrible   the four travelers walked up to the great gate of emerald city and rang the bell after ringing several times it was opened by the same guardian of the gates they had met before  what are you back again he asked in surprise  do you not see us answered the scarecrow  but i thought you had gone to visit the wicked witch of the west  we did visit her said the scarecrow  and she let you go again asked the man in wonder  she could not help it for she is melted explained the scarecrow  melted well that is good news indeed said the man who melted her  it was dorothy said the lion gravely  good gracious exclaimed the man and he bowed very low indeed before her  then he led them into his little room and locked the spectacles from the great box on all their eyes just as he had done before afterward they passed on through the gate into the emerald city when the people heard from the guardian of the gates that dorothy had melted the wicked witch of the west they all gathered around the travelers and followed them in a great crowd to the palace of oz  the soldier with the green whiskers was still on guard before the door but he let them in at once and they were again met by the beautiful green girl who showed each of them to their old rooms at once so they might rest until the great oz was ready to receive them  the soldier had the news carried straight to oz that dorothy and the other travelers had come back again after destroying the wicked witch but oz made no reply they thought the great wizard would send for them at once but he did not they had no word from him the next day nor the next nor the next the waiting was tiresome and wearing and at last they grew vexed that oz should treat them in so poor a fashion after sending them to undergo hardships and slavery so the scarecrow at last asked the green girl to take another message to oz saying if he did not let them in to see him at once they would call the winged monkeys to help them and find out whether he kept his promises or not when the wizard was given this message he was so frightened that he sent word for them to come to the throne room at four minutes after nine o’clock the next morning he had once met the winged monkeys in the land of the west and he did not wish to meet them again  the four travelers passed a sleepless night each thinking of the gift oz had promised to bestow on him dorothy fell asleep only once and then she dreamed she was in kansas where aunt em was telling her how glad she was to have her little girl at home again  promptly at nine o’clock the next morning the green-whiskered soldier came to them and four minutes later they all went into the throne room of the great oz  of course each one of them expected to see the wizard in the shape he had taken before and all were greatly surprised when they looked about and saw no one at all in the room they kept close to the door and closer to one another for the stillness of the empty room was more dreadful than any of the forms they had seen oz take  presently they heard a solemn voice that seemed to come from somewhere near the top of the great dome and it said   i am oz the great and terrible why do you seek me  they looked again in every part of the room and then seeing no one dorothy asked where are you  i am everywhere answered the voice but to the eyes of common mortals i am invisible i will now seat myself upon my throne that you may converse with me indeed the voice seemed just then to come straight from the throne itself so they walked toward it and stood in a row while dorothy said   we have come to claim our promise o oz  what promise asked oz  you promised to send me back to kansas when the wicked witch was destroyed said the girl  and you promised to give me brains said the scarecrow  and you promised to give me a heart said the tin woodman  and you promised to give me courage said the cowardly lion  is the wicked witch really destroyed asked the voice and dorothy thought it trembled a little  yes she answered i melted her with a bucket of water  dear me said the voice how sudden well come to me tomorrow for i must have time to think it over  you’ve had plenty of time already said the tin woodman angrily  we shan’t wait a day longer said the scarecrow  you must keep your promises to us exclaimed dorothy  the lion thought it might be as well to frighten the wizard so he gave a large loud roar which was so fierce and dreadful that toto jumped away from him in alarm and tipped over the screen that stood in a corner as it fell with a crash they looked that way and the next moment all of them were filled with wonder for they saw standing in just the spot the screen had hidden a little old man with a bald head and a wrinkled face who seemed to be as much surprised as they were the tin woodman raising his axe rushed toward the little man and cried out who are you  i am oz the great and terrible said the little man in a trembling voice but don’t strike me—please don’t—and i’ll do anything you want me to  our friends looked at him in surprise and dismay  i thought oz was a great head said dorothy  and i thought oz was a lovely lady said the scarecrow  and i thought oz was a terrible beast said the tin woodman  and i thought oz was a ball of fire exclaimed the lion  no you are all wrong said the little man meekly i have been making believe  making believe cried dorothy are you not a great wizard  hush my dear he said don’t speak so loud or you will be overheard—and i should be ruined i’m supposed to be a great wizard  and aren’t you she asked  not a bit of it my dear i’m just a common man  you’re more than that said the scarecrow in a grieved tone you’re a humbug  exactly so declared the little man rubbing his hands together as if it pleased him i am a humbug  but this is terrible said the tin woodman how shall i ever get my heart  or i my courage asked the lion  or i my brains wailed the scarecrow wiping the tears from his eyes with his coat sleeve  my dear friends said oz i pray you not to speak of these little things think of me and the terrible trouble i’m in at being found out  doesn’t anyone else know you’re a humbug asked dorothy  no one knows it but you four—and myself replied oz i have fooled everyone so long that i thought i should never be found out it was a great mistake my ever letting you into the throne room usually i will not see even my subjects and so they believe i am something terrible  but i don’t understand said dorothy in bewilderment how was it that you appeared to me as a great head  that was one of my tricks answered oz step this way please and i will tell you all about it  he led the way to a small chamber in the rear of the throne room and they all followed him he pointed to one corner in which lay the great head made out of many thicknesses of paper and with a carefully painted face  this i hung from the ceiling by a wire said oz i stood behind the screen and pulled a thread to make the eyes move and the mouth open  but how about the voice she inquired  oh i am a ventriloquist said the little man i can throw the sound of my voice wherever i wish so that you thought it was coming out of the head here are the other things i used to deceive you he showed the scarecrow the dress and the mask he had worn when he seemed to be the lovely lady and the tin woodman saw that his terrible beast was nothing but a lot of skins sewn together with slats to keep their sides out as for the ball of fire the false wizard had hung that also from the ceiling it was really a ball of cotton but when oil was poured upon it the ball burned fiercely  really said the scarecrow you ought to be ashamed of yourself for being such a humbug  i am—i certainly am answered the little man sorrowfully but it was the only thing i could do sit down please there are plenty of chairs and i will tell you my story  so they sat down and listened while he told the following tale  i was born in omaha—  why that isn’t very far from kansas cried dorothy  no but it’s farther from here he said shaking his head at her sadly when i grew up i became a ventriloquist and at that i was very well trained by a great master i can imitate any kind of a bird or beast here he mewed so like a kitten that toto pricked up his ears and looked everywhere to see where she was after a time continued oz i tired of that and became a balloonist  what is that asked dorothy  a man who goes up in a balloon on circus day so as to draw a crowd of people together and get them to pay to see the circus he explained  oh she said i know  well one day i went up in a balloon and the ropes got twisted so that i couldn’t come down again it went way up above the clouds so far that a current of air struck it and carried it many many miles away for a day and a night i traveled through the air and on the morning of the second day i awoke and found the balloon floating over a strange and beautiful country  it came down gradually and i was not hurt a bit but i found myself in the midst of a strange people who seeing me come from the clouds thought i was a great wizard of course i let them think so because they were afraid of me and promised to do anything i wished them to  just to amuse myself and keep the good people busy i ordered them to build this city and my palace and they did it all willingly and well then i thought as the country was so green and beautiful i would call it the emerald city and to make the name fit better i put green spectacles on all the people so that everything they saw was green  but isn’t everything here green asked dorothy  no more than in any other city replied oz but when you wear green spectacles why of course everything you see looks green to you the emerald city was built a great many years ago for i was a young man when the balloon brought me here and i am a very old man now but my people have worn green glasses on their eyes so long that most of them think it really is an emerald city and it certainly is a beautiful place abounding in jewels and precious metals and every good thing that is needed to make one happy i have been good to the people and they like me but ever since this palace was built i have shut myself up and would not see any of them  one of my greatest fears was the witches for while i had no magical powers at all i soon found out that the witches were really able to do wonderful things there were four of them in this country and they ruled the people who live in the north and south and east and west fortunately the witches of the north and south were good and i knew they would do me no harm but the witches of the east and west were terribly wicked and had they not thought i was more powerful than they themselves they would surely have destroyed me as it was i lived in deadly fear of them for many years so you can imagine how pleased i was when i heard your house had fallen on the wicked witch of the east when you came to me i was willing to promise anything if you would only do away with the other witch but now that you have melted her i am ashamed to say that i cannot keep my promises  i think you are a very bad man said dorothy  oh no my dear i’m really a very good man but i’m a very bad wizard i must admit  can’t you give me brains asked the scarecrow  you don’t need them you are learning something every day a baby has brains but it doesn’t know much experience is the only thing that brings knowledge and the longer you are on earth the more experience you are sure to get  that may all be true said the scarecrow but i shall be very unhappy unless you give me brains  the false wizard looked at him carefully  well he said with a sigh i’m not much of a magician as i said but if you will come to me tomorrow morning i will stuff your head with brains i cannot tell you how to use them however you must find that out for yourself  oh thank you—thank you cried the scarecrow i’ll find a way to use them never fear  but how about my courage asked the lion anxiously  you have plenty of courage i am sure answered oz all you need is confidence in yourself there is no living thing that is not afraid when it faces danger the true courage is in facing danger when you are afraid and that kind of courage you have in plenty  perhaps i have but i’m scared just the same said the lion i shall really be very unhappy unless you give me the sort of courage that makes one forget he is afraid  very well i will give you that sort of courage tomorrow replied oz  how about my heart asked the tin woodman  why as for that answered oz i think you are wrong to want a heart it makes most people unhappy if you only knew it you are in luck not to have a heart  that must be a matter of opinion said the tin woodman for my part i will bear all the unhappiness without a murmur if you will give me the heart  very well answered oz meekly come to me tomorrow and you shall have a heart i have played wizard for so many years that i may as well continue the part a little longer  and now said dorothy how am i to get back to kansas  we shall have to think about that replied the little man give me two or three days to consider the matter and i’ll try to find a way to carry you over the desert in the meantime you shall all be treated as my guests and while you live in the palace my people will wait upon you and obey your slightest wish there is only one thing i ask in return for my help—such as it is you must keep my secret and tell no one i am a humbug  they agreed to say nothing of what they had learned and went back to their rooms in high spirits even dorothy had hope that the great and terrible humbug as she called him would find a way to send her back to kansas and if he did she was willing to forgive him everything     chapter xvi the magic art of the great humbug   next morning the scarecrow said to his friends   congratulate me i am going to oz to get my brains at last when i return i shall be as other men are  i have always liked you as you were said dorothy simply  it is kind of you to like a scarecrow he replied but surely you will think more of me when you hear the splendid thoughts my new brain is going to turn out then he said good-bye to them all in a cheerful voice and went to the throne room where he rapped upon the door  come in said oz  the scarecrow went in and found the little man sitting down by the window engaged in deep thought  i have come for my brains remarked the scarecrow a little uneasily  oh yes sit down in that chair please replied oz you must excuse me for taking your head off but i shall have to do it in order to put your brains in their proper place  that’s all right said the scarecrow you are quite welcome to take my head off as long as it will be a better one when you put it on again  so the wizard unfastened his head and emptied out the straw then he entered the back room and took up a measure of bran which he mixed with a great many pins and needles having shaken them together thoroughly he filled the top of the scarecrow’s head with the mixture and stuffed the rest of the space with straw to hold it in place  when he had fastened the scarecrow’s head on his body again he said to him hereafter you will be a great man for i have given you a lot of bran-new brains  the scarecrow was both pleased and proud at the fulfillment of his greatest wish and having thanked oz warmly he went back to his friends  dorothy looked at him curiously his head was quite bulged out at the top with brains  how do you feel she asked  i feel wise indeed he answered earnestly when i get used to my brains i shall know everything  why are those needles and pins sticking out of your head asked the tin woodman  that is proof that he is sharp remarked the lion  well i must go to oz and get my heart said the woodman so he walked to the throne room and knocked at the door  come in called oz and the woodman entered and said i have come for my heart  very well answered the little man but i shall have to cut a hole in your breast so i can put your heart in the right place i hope it won’t hurt you  oh no answered the woodman i shall not feel it at all  so oz brought a pair of tinsmith’s shears and cut a small square hole in the left side of the tin woodman’s breast then going to a chest of drawers he took out a pretty heart made entirely of silk and stuffed with sawdust  isn’t it a beauty he asked  it is indeed replied the woodman who was greatly pleased but is it a kind heart  oh very answered oz he put the heart in the woodman’s breast and then replaced the square of tin soldering it neatly together where it had been cut  there said he now you have a heart that any man might be proud of i’m sorry i had to put a patch on your breast but it really couldn’t be helped  never mind the patch exclaimed the happy woodman i am very grateful to you and shall never forget your kindness  don’t speak of it replied oz  then the tin woodman went back to his friends who wished him every joy on account of his good fortune  the lion now walked to the throne room and knocked at the door  come in said oz  i have come for my courage announced the lion entering the room  very well answered the little man i will get it for you  he went to a cupboard and reaching up to a high shelf took down a square green bottle the contents of which he poured into a green-gold dish beautifully carved placing this before the cowardly lion who sniffed at it as if he did not like it the wizard said   drink  what is it asked the lion  well answered oz if it were inside of you it would be courage you know of course that courage is always inside one so that this really cannot be called courage until you have swallowed it therefore i advise you to drink it as soon as possible  the lion hesitated no longer but drank till the dish was empty  how do you feel now asked oz  full of courage replied the lion who went joyfully back to his friends to tell them of his good fortune  oz left to himself smiled to think of his success in giving the scarecrow and the tin woodman and the lion exactly what they thought they wanted how can i help being a humbug he said when all these people make me do things that everybody knows can’t be done it was easy to make the scarecrow and the lion and the woodman happy because they imagined i could do anything but it will take more than imagination to carry dorothy back to kansas and i’m sure i don’t know how it can be done     chapter xvii how the balloon was launched   for three days dorothy heard nothing from oz these were sad days for the little girl although her friends were all quite happy and contented the scarecrow told them there were wonderful thoughts in his head but he would not say what they were because he knew no one could understand them but himself when the tin woodman walked about he felt his heart rattling around in his breast and he told dorothy he had discovered it to be a kinder and more tender heart than the one he had owned when he was made of flesh the lion declared he was afraid of nothing on earth and would gladly face an army or a dozen of the fierce kalidahs  thus each of the little party was satisfied except dorothy who longed more than ever to get back to kansas  on the fourth day to her great joy oz sent for her and when she entered the throne room he greeted her pleasantly   sit down my dear i think i have found the way to get you out of this country  and back to kansas she asked eagerly  well i’m not sure about kansas said oz for i haven’t the faintest notion which way it lies but the first thing to do is to cross the desert and then it should be easy to find your way home  how can i cross the desert she inquired  well i’ll tell you what i think said the little man you see when i came to this country it was in a balloon you also came through the air being carried by a cyclone so i believe the best way to get across the desert will be through the air now it is quite beyond my powers to make a cyclone but i’ve been thinking the matter over and i believe i can make a balloon  how asked dorothy  a balloon said oz is made of silk which is coated with glue to keep the gas in it i have plenty of silk in the palace so it will be no trouble to make the balloon but in all this country there is no gas to fill the balloon with to make it float  if it won’t float remarked dorothy it will be of no use to us  true answered oz but there is another way to make it float which is to fill it with hot air hot air isn’t as good as gas for if the air should get cold the balloon would come down in the desert and we should be lost  we exclaimed the girl are you going with me  yes of course replied oz i am tired of being such a humbug if i should go out of this palace my people would soon discover i am not a wizard and then they would be vexed with me for having deceived them so i have to stay shut up in these rooms all day and it gets tiresome i’d much rather go back to kansas with you and be in a circus again  i shall be glad to have your company said dorothy  thank you he answered now if you will help me sew the silk together we will begin to work on our balloon  so dorothy took a needle and thread and as fast as oz cut the strips of silk into proper shape the girl sewed them neatly together first there was a strip of light green silk then a strip of dark green and then a strip of emerald green for oz had a fancy to make the balloon in different shades of the color about them it took three days to sew all the strips together but when it was finished they had a big bag of green silk more than twenty feet long  then oz painted it on the inside with a coat of thin glue to make it airtight after which he announced that the balloon was ready  but we must have a basket to ride in he said so he sent the soldier with the green whiskers for a big clothes basket which he fastened with many ropes to the bottom of the balloon  when it was all ready oz sent word to his people that he was going to make a visit to a great brother wizard who lived in the clouds the news spread rapidly throughout the city and everyone came to see the wonderful sight  oz ordered the balloon carried out in front of the palace and the people gazed upon it with much curiosity the tin woodman had chopped a big pile of wood and now he made a fire of it and oz held the bottom of the balloon over the fire so that the hot air that arose from it would be caught in the silken bag gradually the balloon swelled out and rose into the air until finally the basket just touched the ground  then oz got into the basket and said to all the people in a loud voice   i am now going away to make a visit while i am gone the scarecrow will rule over you i command you to obey him as you would me  the balloon was by this time tugging hard at the rope that held it to the ground for the air within it was hot and this made it so much lighter in weight than the air without that it pulled hard to rise into the sky  come dorothy cried the wizard hurry up or the balloon will fly away  i can’t find toto anywhere replied dorothy who did not wish to leave her little dog behind toto had run into the crowd to bark at a kitten and dorothy at last found him she picked him up and ran towards the balloon  she was within a few steps of it and oz was holding out his hands to help her into the basket when crack went the ropes and the balloon rose into the air without her  come back she screamed i want to go too  i can’t come back my dear called oz from the basket good-bye  good-bye shouted everyone and all eyes were turned upward to where the wizard was riding in the basket rising every moment farther and farther into the sky  and that was the last any of them ever saw of oz the wonderful wizard though he may have reached omaha safely and be there now for all we know but the people remembered him lovingly and said to one another   oz was always our friend when he was here he built for us this beautiful emerald city and now he is gone he has left the wise scarecrow to rule over us  still for many days they grieved over the loss of the wonderful wizard and would not be comforted     chapter xviii away to the south   dorothy wept bitterly at the passing of her hope to get home to kansas again but when she thought it all over she was glad she had not gone up in a balloon and she also felt sorry at losing oz and so did her companions  the tin woodman came to her and said   truly i should be ungrateful if i failed to mourn for the man who gave me my lovely heart i should like to cry a little because oz is gone if you will kindly wipe away my tears so that i shall not rust  with pleasure she answered and brought a towel at once then the tin woodman wept for several minutes and she watched the tears carefully and wiped them away with the towel when he had finished he thanked her kindly and oiled himself thoroughly with his jeweled oil-can to guard against mishap  the scarecrow was now the ruler of the emerald city and although he was not a wizard the people were proud of him for they said there is not another city in all the world that is ruled by a stuffed man and so far as they knew they were quite right  the morning after the balloon had gone up with oz the four travelers met in the throne room and talked matters over the scarecrow sat in the big throne and the others stood respectfully before him  we are not so unlucky said the new ruler for this palace and the emerald city belong to us and we can do just as we please when i remember that a short time ago i was up on a pole in a farmer’s cornfield and that now i am the ruler of this beautiful city i am quite satisfied with my lot  i also said the tin woodman am well-pleased with my new heart and really that was the only thing i wished in all the world  for my part i am content in knowing i am as brave as any beast that ever lived if not braver said the lion modestly  if dorothy would only be contented to live in the emerald city continued the scarecrow we might all be happy together  but i don’t want to live here cried dorothy i want to go to kansas and live with aunt em and uncle henry  well then what can be done inquired the woodman  the scarecrow decided to think and he thought so hard that the pins and needles began to stick out of his brains finally he said   why not call the winged monkeys and ask them to carry you over the desert  i never thought of that said dorothy joyfully it’s just the thing i’ll go at once for the golden cap  when she brought it into the throne room she spoke the magic words and soon the band of winged monkeys flew in through the open window and stood beside her  this is the second time you have called us said the monkey king bowing before the little girl what do you wish  i want you to fly with me to kansas said dorothy  but the monkey king shook his head  that cannot be done he said we belong to this country alone and cannot leave it there has never been a winged monkey in kansas yet and i suppose there never will be for they don’t belong there we shall be glad to serve you in any way in our power but we cannot cross the desert good-bye  and with another bow the monkey king spread his wings and flew away through the window followed by all his band  dorothy was ready to cry with disappointment i have wasted the charm of the golden cap to no purpose she said for the winged monkeys cannot help me  it is certainly too bad said the tender-hearted woodman  the scarecrow was thinking again and his head bulged out so horribly that dorothy feared it would burst  let us call in the soldier with the green whiskers he said and ask his advice  so the soldier was summoned and entered the throne room timidly for while oz was alive he never was allowed to come farther than the door  this little girl said the scarecrow to the soldier wishes to cross the desert how can she do so  i cannot tell answered the soldier for nobody has ever crossed the desert unless it is oz himself  is there no one who can help me asked dorothy earnestly  glinda might he suggested  who is glinda inquired the scarecrow  the witch of the south she is the most powerful of all the witches and rules over the quadlings besides her castle stands on the edge of the desert so she may know a way to cross it  glinda is a good witch isn’t she asked the child  the quadlings think she is good said the soldier and she is kind to everyone i have heard that glinda is a beautiful woman who knows how to keep young in spite of the many years she has lived  how can i get to her castle asked dorothy  the road is straight to the south he answered but it is said to be full of dangers to travelers there are wild beasts in the woods and a race of queer men who do not like strangers to cross their country for this reason none of the quadlings ever come to the emerald city  the soldier then left them and the scarecrow said   it seems in spite of dangers that the best thing dorothy can do is to travel to the land of the south and ask glinda to help her for of course if dorothy stays here she will never get back to kansas  you must have been thinking again remarked the tin woodman  i have said the scarecrow  i shall go with dorothy declared the lion for i am tired of your city and long for the woods and the country again i am really a wild beast you know besides dorothy will need someone to protect her  that is true agreed the woodman my axe may be of service to her so i also will go with her to the land of the south  when shall we start asked the scarecrow  are you going they asked in surprise  certainly if it wasn’t for dorothy i should never have had brains she lifted me from the pole in the cornfield and brought me to the emerald city so my good luck is all due to her and i shall never leave her until she starts back to kansas for good and all  thank you said dorothy gratefully you are all very kind to me but i should like to start as soon as possible  we shall go tomorrow morning returned the scarecrow so now let us all get ready for it will be a long journey     chapter xix attacked by the fighting trees   the next morning dorothy kissed the pretty green girl good-bye and they all shook hands with the soldier with the green whiskers who had walked with them as far as the gate when the guardian of the gate saw them again he wondered greatly that they could leave the beautiful city to get into new trouble but he at once unlocked their spectacles which he put back into the green box and gave them many good wishes to carry with them  you are now our ruler he said to the scarecrow so you must come back to us as soon as possible  i certainly shall if i am able the scarecrow replied but i must help dorothy to get home first  as dorothy bade the good-natured guardian a last farewell she said   i have been very kindly treated in your lovely city and everyone has been good to me i cannot tell you how grateful i am  don’t try my dear he answered we should like to keep you with us but if it is your wish to return to kansas i hope you will find a way he then opened the gate of the outer wall and they walked forth and started upon their journey  the sun shone brightly as our friends turned their faces toward the land of the south they were all in the best of spirits and laughed and chatted together dorothy was once more filled with the hope of getting home and the scarecrow and the tin woodman were glad to be of use to her as for the lion he sniffed the fresh air with delight and whisked his tail from side to side in pure joy at being in the country again while toto ran around them and chased the moths and butterflies barking merrily all the time  city life does not agree with me at all remarked the lion as they walked along at a brisk pace i have lost much flesh since i lived there and now i am anxious for a chance to show the other beasts how courageous i have grown  they now turned and took a last look at the emerald city all they could see was a mass of towers and steeples behind the green walls and high up above everything the spires and dome of the palace of oz  oz was not such a bad wizard after all said the tin woodman as he felt his heart rattling around in his breast  he knew how to give me brains and very good brains too said the scarecrow  if oz had taken a dose of the same courage he gave me added the lion he would have been a brave man  dorothy said nothing oz had not kept the promise he made her but he had done his best so she forgave him as he said he was a good man even if he was a bad wizard  the first day’s journey was through the green fields and bright flowers that stretched about the emerald city on every side they slept that night on the grass with nothing but the stars over them and they rested very well indeed  in the morning they traveled on until they came to a thick wood there was no way of going around it for it seemed to extend to the right and left as far as they could see and besides they did not dare change the direction of their journey for fear of getting lost so they looked for the place where it would be easiest to get into the forest  the scarecrow who was in the lead finally discovered a big tree with such wide-spreading branches that there was room for the party to pass underneath so he walked forward to the tree but just as he came under the first branches they bent down and twined around him and the next minute he was raised from the ground and flung headlong among his fellow travelers  this did not hurt the scarecrow but it surprised him and he looked rather dizzy when dorothy picked him up  here is another space between the trees called the lion  let me try it first said the scarecrow for it doesn’t hurt me to get thrown about he walked up to another tree as he spoke but its branches immediately seized him and tossed him back again  this is strange exclaimed dorothy what shall we do  the trees seem to have made up their minds to fight us and stop our journey remarked the lion  i believe i will try it myself said the woodman and shouldering his axe he marched up to the first tree that had handled the scarecrow so roughly when a big branch bent down to seize him the woodman chopped at it so fiercely that he cut it in two at once the tree began shaking all its branches as if in pain and the tin woodman passed safely under it  come on he shouted to the others be quick they all ran forward and passed under the tree without injury except toto who was caught by a small branch and shaken until he howled but the woodman promptly chopped off the branch and set the little dog free  the other trees of the forest did nothing to keep them back so they made up their minds that only the first row of trees could bend down their branches and that probably these were the policemen of the forest and given this wonderful power in order to keep strangers out of it  the four travelers walked with ease through the trees until they came to the farther edge of the wood then to their surprise they found before them a high wall which seemed to be made of white china it was smooth like the surface of a dish and higher than their heads  what shall we do now asked dorothy  i will make a ladder said the tin woodman for we certainly must climb over the wall     chapter xx the dainty china country   while the woodman was making a ladder from wood which he found in the forest dorothy lay down and slept for she was tired by the long walk the lion also curled himself up to sleep and toto lay beside him  the scarecrow watched the woodman while he worked and said to him   i cannot think why this wall is here nor what it is made of  rest your brains and do not worry about the wall replied the woodman when we have climbed over it we shall know what is on the other side  after a time the ladder was finished it looked clumsy but the tin woodman was sure it was strong and would answer their purpose the scarecrow waked dorothy and the lion and toto and told them that the ladder was ready the scarecrow climbed up the ladder first but he was so awkward that dorothy had to follow close behind and keep him from falling off when he got his head over the top of the wall the scarecrow said oh my  go on exclaimed dorothy  so the scarecrow climbed farther up and sat down on the top of the wall and dorothy put her head over and cried oh my just as the scarecrow had done  then toto came up and immediately began to bark but dorothy made him be still  the lion climbed the ladder next and the tin woodman came last but both of them cried oh my as soon as they looked over the wall when they were all sitting in a row on the top of the wall they looked down and saw a strange sight  before them was a great stretch of country having a floor as smooth and shining and white as the bottom of a big platter scattered around were many houses made entirely of china and painted in the brightest colors these houses were quite small the biggest of them reaching only as high as dorothy’s waist there were also pretty little barns with china fences around them and many cows and sheep and horses and pigs and chickens all made of china were standing about in groups  but the strangest of all were the people who lived in this queer country there were milkmaids and shepherdesses with brightly colored bodices and golden spots all over their gowns and princesses with most gorgeous frocks of silver and gold and purple and shepherds dressed in knee breeches with pink and yellow and blue stripes down them and golden buckles on their shoes and princes with jeweled crowns upon their heads wearing ermine robes and satin doublets and funny clowns in ruffled gowns with round red spots upon their cheeks and tall pointed caps and strangest of all these people were all made of china even to their clothes and were so small that the tallest of them was no higher than dorothy’s knee  no one did so much as look at the travelers at first except one little purple china dog with an extra-large head which came to the wall and barked at them in a tiny voice afterwards running away again  how shall we get down asked dorothy  they found the ladder so heavy they could not pull it up so the scarecrow fell off the wall and the others jumped down upon him so that the hard floor would not hurt their feet of course they took pains not to light on his head and get the pins in their feet when all were safely down they picked up the scarecrow whose body was quite flattened out and patted his straw into shape again  we must cross this strange place in order to get to the other side said dorothy for it would be unwise for us to go any other way except due south  they began walking through the country of the china people and the first thing they came to was a china milkmaid milking a china cow as they drew near the cow suddenly gave a kick and kicked over the stool the pail and even the milkmaid herself and all fell on the china ground with a great clatter  dorothy was shocked to see that the cow had broken her leg off and that the pail was lying in several small pieces while the poor milkmaid had a nick in her left elbow  there cried the milkmaid angrily see what you have done my cow has broken her leg and i must take her to the mender’s shop and have it glued on again what do you mean by coming here and frightening my cow  i’m very sorry returned dorothy please forgive us  but the pretty milkmaid was much too vexed to make any answer she picked up the leg sulkily and led her cow away the poor animal limping on three legs as she left them the milkmaid cast many reproachful glances over her shoulder at the clumsy strangers holding her nicked elbow close to her side  dorothy was quite grieved at this mishap  we must be very careful here said the kind-hearted woodman or we may hurt these pretty little people so they will never get over it  a little farther on dorothy met a most beautifully dressed young princess who stopped short as she saw the strangers and started to run away  dorothy wanted to see more of the princess so she ran after her but the china girl cried out   don’t chase me don’t chase me  she had such a frightened little voice that dorothy stopped and said why not  because answered the princess also stopping a safe distance away if i run i may fall down and break myself  but could you not be mended asked the girl  oh yes but one is never so pretty after being mended you know replied the princess  i suppose not said dorothy  now there is mr joker one of our clowns continued the china lady who is always trying to stand upon his head he has broken himself so often that he is mended in a hundred places and doesn’t look at all pretty here he comes now so you can see for yourself  indeed a jolly little clown came walking toward them and dorothy could see that in spite of his pretty clothes of red and yellow and green he was completely covered with cracks running every which way and showing plainly that he had been mended in many places  the clown put his hands in his pockets and after puffing out his cheeks and nodding his head at them saucily he said       my lady fair    why do you stare at poor old mr joker     you’re quite as stiff     and prim as if you’d eaten up a poker   be quiet sir said the princess can’t you see these are strangers and should be treated with respect  well that’s respect i expect declared the clown and immediately stood upon his head  don’t mind mr joker said the princess to dorothy he is considerably cracked in his head and that makes him foolish  oh i don’t mind him a bit said dorothy but you are so beautiful she continued that i am sure i could love you dearly won’t you let me carry you back to kansas and stand you on aunt em’s mantel i could carry you in my basket  that would make me very unhappy answered the china princess you see here in our country we live contentedly and can talk and move around as we please but whenever any of us are taken away our joints at once stiffen and we can only stand straight and look pretty of course that is all that is expected of us when we are on mantels and cabinets and drawing-room tables but our lives are much pleasanter here in our own country  i would not make you unhappy for all the world exclaimed dorothy so i’ll just say good-bye  good-bye replied the princess  they walked carefully through the china country the little animals and all the people scampered out of their way fearing the strangers would break them and after an hour or so the travelers reached the other side of the country and came to another china wall  it was not so high as the first however and by standing upon the lion’s back they all managed to scramble to the top then the lion gathered his legs under him and jumped on the wall but just as he jumped he upset a china church with his tail and smashed it all to pieces  that was too bad said dorothy but really i think we were lucky in not doing these little people more harm than breaking a cow’s leg and a church they are all so brittle  they are indeed said the scarecrow and i am thankful i am made of straw and cannot be easily damaged there are worse things in the world than being a scarecrow     chapter xxi the lion becomes the king of beasts   after climbing down from the china wall the travelers found themselves in a disagreeable country full of bogs and marshes and covered with tall rank grass it was difficult to walk without falling into muddy holes for the grass was so thick that it hid them from sight however by carefully picking their way they got safely along until they reached solid ground but here the country seemed wilder than ever and after a long and tiresome walk through the underbrush they entered another forest where the trees were bigger and older than any they had ever seen  this forest is perfectly delightful declared the lion looking around him with joy never have i seen a more beautiful place  it seems gloomy said the scarecrow  not a bit of it answered the lion i should like to live here all my life see how soft the dried leaves are under your feet and how rich and green the moss is that clings to these old trees surely no wild beast could wish a pleasanter home  perhaps there are wild beasts in the forest now said dorothy  i suppose there are returned the lion but i do not see any of them about  they walked through the forest until it became too dark to go any farther dorothy and toto and the lion lay down to sleep while the woodman and the scarecrow kept watch over them as usual  when morning came they started again before they had gone far they heard a low rumble as of the growling of many wild animals toto whimpered a little but none of the others was frightened and they kept along the well-trodden path until they came to an opening in the wood in which were gathered hundreds of beasts of every variety there were tigers and elephants and bears and wolves and foxes and all the others in the natural history and for a moment dorothy was afraid but the lion explained that the animals were holding a meeting and he judged by their snarling and growling that they were in great trouble  as he spoke several of the beasts caught sight of him and at once the great assemblage hushed as if by magic the biggest of the tigers came up to the lion and bowed saying   welcome o king of beasts you have come in good time to fight our enemy and bring peace to all the animals of the forest once more  what is your trouble asked the lion quietly  we are all threatened answered the tiger by a fierce enemy which has lately come into this forest it is a most tremendous monster like a great spider with a body as big as an elephant and legs as long as a tree trunk it has eight of these long legs and as the monster crawls through the forest he seizes an animal with a leg and drags it to his mouth where he eats it as a spider does a fly not one of us is safe while this fierce creature is alive and we had called a meeting to decide how to take care of ourselves when you came among us  the lion thought for a moment  are there any other lions in this forest he asked  no there were some but the monster has eaten them all and besides they were none of them nearly so large and brave as you  if i put an end to your enemy will you bow down to me and obey me as king of the forest inquired the lion  we will do that gladly returned the tiger and all the other beasts roared with a mighty roar  we will  where is this great spider of yours now asked the lion  yonder among the oak trees said the tiger pointing with his forefoot  take good care of these friends of mine said the lion and i will go at once to fight the monster  he bade his comrades good-bye and marched proudly away to do battle with the enemy  the great spider was lying asleep when the lion found him and it looked so ugly that its foe turned up his nose in disgust its legs were quite as long as the tiger had said and its body covered with coarse black hair it had a great mouth with a row of sharp teeth a foot long but its head was joined to the pudgy body by a neck as slender as a wasp’s waist this gave the lion a hint of the best way to attack the creature and as he knew it was easier to fight it asleep than awake he gave a great spring and landed directly upon the monster’s back then with one blow of his heavy paw all armed with sharp claws he knocked the spider’s head from its body jumping down he watched it until the long legs stopped wiggling when he knew it was quite dead  the lion went back to the opening where the beasts of the forest were waiting for him and said proudly   you need fear your enemy no longer  then the beasts bowed down to the lion as their king and he promised to come back and rule over them as soon as dorothy was safely on her way to kansas     chapter xxii the country of the quadlings   the four travelers passed through the rest of the forest in safety and when they came out from its gloom saw before them a steep hill covered from top to bottom with great pieces of rock  that will be a hard climb said the scarecrow but we must get over the hill nevertheless  so he led the way and the others followed they had nearly reached the first rock when they heard a rough voice cry out keep back  who are you asked the scarecrow  then a head showed itself over the rock and the same voice said this hill belongs to us and we don’t allow anyone to cross it  but we must cross it said the scarecrow we’re going to the country of the quadlings  but you shall not replied the voice and there stepped from behind the rock the strangest man the travelers had ever seen  he was quite short and stout and had a big head which was flat at the top and supported by a thick neck full of wrinkles but he had no arms at all and seeing this the scarecrow did not fear that so helpless a creature could prevent them from climbing the hill so he said i’m sorry not to do as you wish but we must pass over your hill whether you like it or not and he walked boldly forward  as quick as lightning the man’s head shot forward and his neck stretched out until the top of the head where it was flat struck the scarecrow in the middle and sent him tumbling over and over down the hill almost as quickly as it came the head went back to the body and the man laughed harshly as he said it isn’t as easy as you think  a chorus of boisterous laughter came from the other rocks and dorothy saw hundreds of the armless hammer-heads upon the hillside one behind every rock  the lion became quite angry at the laughter caused by the scarecrow’s mishap and giving a loud roar that echoed like thunder he dashed up the hill  again a head shot swiftly out and the great lion went rolling down the hill as if he had been struck by a cannon ball  dorothy ran down and helped the scarecrow to his feet and the lion came up to her feeling rather bruised and sore and said it is useless to fight people with shooting heads no one can withstand them  what can we do then she asked  call the winged monkeys suggested the tin woodman you have still the right to command them once more  very well she answered and putting on the golden cap she uttered the magic words the monkeys were as prompt as ever and in a few moments the entire band stood before her  what are your commands inquired the king of the monkeys bowing low  carry us over the hill to the country of the quadlings answered the girl  it shall be done said the king and at once the winged monkeys caught the four travelers and toto up in their arms and flew away with them as they passed over the hill the hammer-heads yelled with vexation and shot their heads high in the air but they could not reach the winged monkeys which carried dorothy and her comrades safely over the hill and set them down in the beautiful country of the quadlings  this is the last time you can summon us said the leader to dorothy so good-bye and good luck to you  good-bye and thank you very much returned the girl and the monkeys rose into the air and were out of sight in a twinkling  the country of the quadlings seemed rich and happy there was field upon field of ripening grain with well-paved roads running between and pretty rippling brooks with strong bridges across them the fences and houses and bridges were all painted bright red just as they had been painted yellow in the country of the winkies and blue in the country of the munchkins the quadlings themselves who were short and fat and looked chubby and good-natured were dressed all in red which showed bright against the green grass and the yellowing grain  the monkeys had set them down near a farmhouse and the four travelers walked up to it and knocked at the door it was opened by the farmer’s wife and when dorothy asked for something to eat the woman gave them all a good dinner with three kinds of cake and four kinds of cookies and a bowl of milk for toto  how far is it to the castle of glinda asked the child  it is not a great way answered the farmer’s wife take the road to the south and you will soon reach it  thanking the good woman they started afresh and walked by the fields and across the pretty bridges until they saw before them a very beautiful castle before the gates were three young girls dressed in handsome red uniforms trimmed with gold braid and as dorothy approached one of them said to her   why have you come to the south country  to see the good witch who rules here she answered will you take me to her  let me have your name and i will ask glinda if she will receive you they told who they were and the girl soldier went into the castle after a few moments she came back to say that dorothy and the others were to be admitted at once     chapter xxiii glinda the good witch grants dorothy’s wish   before they went to see glinda however they were taken to a room of the castle where dorothy washed her face and combed her hair and the lion shook the dust out of his mane and the scarecrow patted himself into his best shape and the woodman polished his tin and oiled his joints  when they were all quite presentable they followed the soldier girl into a big room where the witch glinda sat upon a throne of rubies  she was both beautiful and young to their eyes her hair was a rich red in color and fell in flowing ringlets over her shoulders her dress was pure white but her eyes were blue and they looked kindly upon the little girl  what can i do for you my child she asked  dorothy told the witch all her story  how the cyclone had brought her to the land of oz how she had found her companions and of the wonderful adventures they had met with  my greatest wish now she added is to get back to kansas for aunt em will surely think something dreadful has happened to me and that will make her put on mourning and unless the crops are better this year than they were last i am sure uncle henry cannot afford it  glinda leaned forward and kissed the sweet upturned face of the loving little girl  bless your dear heart she said i am sure i can tell you of a way to get back to kansas then she added but if i do you must give me the golden cap  willingly exclaimed dorothy indeed it is of no use to me now and when you have it you can command the winged monkeys three times  and i think i shall need their service just those three times answered glinda smiling  dorothy then gave her the golden cap and the witch said to the scarecrow what will you do when dorothy has left us  i will return to the emerald city he replied for oz has made me its ruler and the people like me the only thing that worries me is how to cross the hill of the hammer-heads  by means of the golden cap i shall command the winged monkeys to carry you to the gates of the emerald city said glinda for it would be a shame to deprive the people of so wonderful a ruler  am i really wonderful asked the scarecrow  you are unusual replied glinda  turning to the tin woodman she asked what will become of you when dorothy leaves this country  he leaned on his axe and thought a moment then he said the winkies were very kind to me and wanted me to rule over them after the wicked witch died i am fond of the winkies and if i could get back again to the country of the west i should like nothing better than to rule over them forever  my second command to the winged monkeys said glinda will be that they carry you safely to the land of the winkies your brain may not be so large to look at as those of the scarecrow but you are really brighter than he is—when you are well polished—and i am sure you will rule the winkies wisely and well  then the witch looked at the big shaggy lion and asked when dorothy has returned to her own home what will become of you  over the hill of the hammer-heads he answered lies a grand old forest and all the beasts that live there have made me their king if i could only get back to this forest i would pass my life very happily there  my third command to the winged monkeys said glinda shall be to carry you to your forest then having used up the powers of the golden cap i shall give it to the king of the monkeys that he and his band may thereafter be free for evermore  the scarecrow and the tin woodman and the lion now thanked the good witch earnestly for her kindness and dorothy exclaimed   you are certainly as good as you are beautiful but you have not yet told me how to get back to kansas  your silver shoes will carry you over the desert replied glinda if you had known their power you could have gone back to your aunt em the very first day you came to this country  but then i should not have had my wonderful brains cried the scarecrow i might have passed my whole life in the farmer’s cornfield  and i should not have had my lovely heart said the tin woodman i might have stood and rusted in the forest till the end of the world  and i should have lived a coward forever declared the lion and no beast in all the forest would have had a good word to say to me  this is all true said dorothy and i am glad i was of use to these good friends but now that each of them has had what he most desired and each is happy in having a kingdom to rule besides i think i should like to go back to kansas  the silver shoes said the good witch have wonderful powers and one of the most curious things about them is that they can carry you to any place in the world in three steps and each step will be made in the wink of an eye all you have to do is to knock the heels together three times and command the shoes to carry you wherever you wish to go  if that is so said the child joyfully i will ask them to carry me back to kansas at once  she threw her arms around the lion’s neck and kissed him patting his big head tenderly then she kissed the tin woodman who was weeping in a way most dangerous to his joints but she hugged the soft stuffed body of the scarecrow in her arms instead of kissing his painted face and found she was crying herself at this sorrowful parting from her loving comrades  glinda the good stepped down from her ruby throne to give the little girl a good-bye kiss and dorothy thanked her for all the kindness she had shown to her friends and herself  dorothy now took toto up solemnly in her arms and having said one last good-bye she clapped the heels of her shoes together three times saying   take me home to aunt em   instantly she was whirling through the air so swiftly that all she could see or feel was the wind whistling past her ears  the silver shoes took but three steps and then she stopped so suddenly that she rolled over upon the grass several times before she knew where she was  at length however she sat up and looked about her  good gracious she cried  for she was sitting on the broad kansas prairie and just before her was the new farmhouse uncle henry built after the cyclone had carried away the old one uncle henry was milking the cows in the barnyard and toto had jumped out of her arms and was running toward the barn barking furiously  dorothy stood up and found she was in her stocking-feet for the silver shoes had fallen off in her flight through the air and were lost forever in the desert     chapter xxiv home again   aunt em had just come out of the house to water the cabbages when she looked up and saw dorothy running toward her  my darling child she cried folding the little girl in her arms and covering her face with kisses where in the world did you come from  from the land of oz said dorothy gravely and here is toto too and oh aunt em i’m so glad to be at home again"@"The Wonderful Land of Oz"@"L.Frank Baum"
